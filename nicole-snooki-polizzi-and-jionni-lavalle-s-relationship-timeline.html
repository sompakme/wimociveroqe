HOWEVER you will not see me on her reality show. Being a reality was never something I wanted to be when I grew up,” <a href=#>LaValle wrote via Instagram in January 2018</a>, shutting down rumors that there was trouble in paradise. “I own my own business and work hard at it, that’s what I do. My wife is a reality star and works hard at that, that’s what she does. We ARE not divorced.”</p><p>He continued: “For the HATERS I hope this message finds you and confuses you even more about life and for the FANS of my wife and her show …I got your back!!! God Bless Yas!”</p><p>Three months later, Polizzi clapped back at claims that she and LaValle had separated.</p><p>“I’m still proudly wearing my ring,” the Jersey Shore: Family Vacation star <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> in April 2018. “We are totally fine. We don’t post our life on social media, but I love him to death and he’s my best friend and he’s just a little shy so leave him alone.”</p><p>Amid their highs and lows, the couple announced in November 2018 that they were expecting their third child together.</p><p>The twosome <a href=#>welcomed son Angelo</a> in May 2019. Seven months later, Polizzi announced that she was “retiring” from Jersey Shore to spend more time with her loved ones.</p><p>“I hate being away from the kids,” she said during her “<a href=#>It’s Happening With Snooki & Joey</a>” podcast in December 2019. “I don’t like partying three days in a row. It’s just not my life anymore. And I wanna be home with the kids. You know, like, I don’t mind a here and there going to a dinner or whatever, but it’s just really hard on me to leave the kids and film the show.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The MTV star has since returned to the reality show — but <a href=#>still tries to keep her husband and three children</a> out of the limelight.</p><p>Scroll through for a timeline of Polizzi and LaValle’s relationship:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNku6qvzqWcZquepLystYyppqWhqq%2B2bq3NnWSjoZ%2Bju6p5y5qtmqScmsBuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZquipZWhtq%2Bxjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
