Like he was undressing me with his eyes,” she wrote in her Amazon essay, which was published on February 1. In the excerpt, Simpson recalled <a href=#>first meeting the mystery man at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards</a>.</p><p>The Texas native, <a href=#>who later was married to Lachey, 49, from 2002 to 2006</a>, recalled how she “wasn’t ready” for anything serious. Simpson claimed she continued <a href=#>to cross paths with the unnamed guy which eventually led to an affair.</a></p><p>“Yes, there was something sexy and enticing about all this, but there was also something demeaning about it. I felt like a call girl,” she continued. “I didn’t care if he was my teenage fantasy come to life, this was not a choice that same girl, my younger self, would be proud of.”</p><p>Following their split, the “With You” performer <a href=#>started dating Johnson in 2010 and they announced their engagement</a> later that year. The pair, who tied the knot in 2014, <a href=#>share daughters Maxwell, 10, Birdie, 3, and son Ace, 9.</a></p><p>The Dukes of Hazzard star previously <a href=#>offered a glimpse at her dynamic with Johnson</a>. “I don’t feel like our marriage has been long, but I feel like I’ve loved Eric my whole life,” she exclusively told Us in April 2022. “I guess in the moment I met him, it felt like a marriage. We rarely fight. If we do, it’s more conversational, and it’s not like, ‘He’s right or she’s right.’ It’s not about winning.”</p><p>The Open Book author also revealed that <a href=#>she doesn’t have plans to have more kids</a>. “I have no baby fever,” she added. “The third pregnancy for me [in 2019], that was it. I can’t do that again. The last pregnancy for me was really hard.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>At the time, Simpson detailed how having a child “later in life” was “a lot harder” than she expected, saying, “It’s just something that you end up accepting. I got a great child out of it who I adore and love and she rules the house. She definitely is the most heard in the family.”</p><p>For more on Simpson and Johnson’s marriage, watch the video above and pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly — on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaipqOesaZ5xKugnGWapLWvv86nqmaqlZawtbXOp2Stp12fsrS%2FyJyYZquZor20u82sZKmZo6l6orLFmqCrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
