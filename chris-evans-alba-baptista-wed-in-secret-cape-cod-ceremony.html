At the time, People magazine noted that Alba Baptista was a feature of Chris' then-recent posts --&nbsp;adding&nbsp;that he "gushed" about her:</p><p>"Before Evans began his social media sabbatical, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Knives Out star</a> frequently gushed about his relationship with his girlfriend, actress Alba Baptista. In January, he shared a video compilation with fans that showed how the couple spent 2022 together. The brief video showed the couple surprising each other. In the last clip, Baptista, 25, appeared accustomed to Evans' jokes. 'I knew it,' she said as Evans tried to&nbsp;[startle] her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In retrospect, it's possible Chris also ditched social media to free up time&nbsp;for&nbsp;coordinating and&nbsp;planning a celebrity wedding. According to InStyle, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors about the wedding</a> kicked off after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many recognizable MCU&nbsp;mainstays</a> were spotted in Boston, just north of swanky Cape Cod:</p><p>"Prior to the news breaking in the late afternoon on Sunday [September 10th], rumors were swirling that something was happening as Evans's pals, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including Robert Downey Jr.</a> and his wife, Susan Downey; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Hemsworth and his wife</a>, Elsa Pataky; and Jeremy Renner; and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Krasinski and Emily Blunt</a> were seen in Boston."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Taylor Swift Attends Jack Antonoff & Margaret Qualley’s Luxe Wedding That Cost A Fortune" href=#>Taylor Swift Attends Jack Antonoff & Margaret Qualley’s Luxe Wedding That Cost A Fortune</a></span></p><p>Chris candidly discussed&nbsp;the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">matter of marriage and family</a> in November, when he was profiled as People's "Sexiest Man Alive" for 2022. When asked about work life balance, Chris explained:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"That's absolutely something I want: wife, kids, building a family&nbsp;... When you read about most of the best artists, whether it's actors, painters, writers, most of them [admit] it wasn't the work they made [that they are most proud of], it was about the relationships; the families they created, the love they found, the love they shared&nbsp;...&nbsp;So it's also something through my long 41 years that also rings true. Those things are the most important&nbsp;... I love the idea of tradition and ceremony. I had a lot of that in my life, so the idea of creating that — I can't think of anything better."</p><p>While Chris was open about his feelings on marriage and kids, the&nbsp;newlyweds were&nbsp;markedly quiet about&nbsp;their star-studded wedding ceremony. Several outlets reported that guests were required to sign non-disclosure agreements,&nbsp;and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times&nbsp;echoed reports that</a>&nbsp;much of the information about the wedding came from fan observations:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Representatives for [Chris] Evans and [Alba] Baptista did not respond to The Times’ requests for comment.</p><p>"During the intimate event, attendees reportedly were required to sign nondisclosure agreements and surrender their phones. But fans began to connect the dots after Downey and wife Susan Downey, Hemsworth and wife Elsa Pataky and [Jeremy] Renner were spotted dining together at a restaurant in Boston — Evans’ hometown."</p><p>Neither photos nor videos of the event have yet been released. That's not entirely a surprise, as some fans <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">criticized the age gap</a> between Chris, 42, and Alba, 26.&nbsp;Scott Evans, Chris' brother, said it was hard for his sibling to date "in the public eye."</p><p>Chris and his new wife Alba&nbsp;had&nbsp;yet to comment on their "hush hush" wedding at press time.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendall Jenner Disses Her Sisters By Revealing Why She Refuses To Open A Beauty Brand Like Them</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSwqb7IrGSerpGjwG6ty5uYZpqRpcGqv9OaZLCdlGK2r3nSnpqrnaRisKK8xGaaqJxdmLKzscyopbJn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
