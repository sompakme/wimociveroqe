After years of being mistreated by her late mother Debra McCurdy, she spilled everything that went on, and fans were heartbroken. McCurdy has been praised for being so real and talking about things that are very difficult. She even opened up about realizing that <a href=#>Mark McCurdy wasn't her biological dad</a>.</p><p>Now that Jennette McCurdy has a new podcast called Hard Feelings, she is digging deep into the thoughts that she has surrounding her life and career. Throughout several episodes, McCurdy has mentioned her family, and in some cases she has shared more about her mom, who mistreated her. Here's what McCurdy has talked about on the podcast.</p><h2 id=jennette-mccurdy-39-s-mom-forced-her-into-acting><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jennette McCurdy's Mom Forced Her Into Acting</span></h2><h3 id=episode-1-quot-shame-quot-october-24th-2023>Episode 1, "Shame," October 24th 2023</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Why-Sam-And-Cat-Star-Jennette-McCurdy-Called-Out-Nickelodeon-Fans.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennette McCurdy shared in the first episode of her Hard Feelings podcast that she feels "shame" when she thinks about starring in iCarly and Sam and Cat.

She said that she had negative emotions about it:</p><p>"I was really trying to be vulnerable and hopefully, ideally, helpful with what I was saying up here... and now this just makes me feel really bad."</p><p>Since <a href=#>Jennette McCurdy's mom treated her horribly</a> and wanted her to act from a young age, the star has a lot of feelings about it. McCurdy shared in the episode that after talking to her therapist, she knew that her "shame" over her early acting days wasn't gone. She said, "I thought the success of the book would be enough" so reporters didn't have to think of her as the 13-year-old star of iCarly and Sam and Cat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Stats About Jennette McCurdy's Book "I'm Glad My Mom Died" (According to Simon and Schuster)</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>20 printings of the book</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>more than 2 million copies purchased</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>New York Times bestseller list for 52 weeks</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=jennette-mccurdy-39-s-mom-ignored-who-she-was-and-what-she-needed><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jennette McCurdy's Mom Ignored Who She Was And What She Needed</span></h2><h3 id=episode-1-quot-shame-quot-october-24th-2023>Episode 1, "Shame," October 24th 2023</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/did-jennette-mccurdy-ever-find-her-biological-father-after-discovering-mark-mccurdy-wasn-t-actually-her-dad_.jpg><p>In the same episode, Jennette McCurdy delved into how her mom behaved when she was in her early teenage years.

She explained that she read an email that she was accidentally copied on and her team asked if enough fans had pre-ordered the book in order for her to reach the number one spot of The New York Times bestsellers list.

Since she shared so much about her relationship with her mom, it makes sense that McCurdy would want the book to do really well. In fact, the book did so well that, in November 2022, Publishers Weekly reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McCurdy got a two-book deal</a> for two novels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Some Stories From 'I'm Glad My Mom Died" (According to Buzzfeed)</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Jennette McCurdy had her own apartment at 18, but Debra McCurdy stayed over for a period of three months</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Debra wanted Jennette to only consume 1,000 calories daily</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Debra thought Jennette should act starting from the time she was 6</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=jennette-mccurdy-talked-about-mark-mccurdy-39-s-bad-behavior-at-her-mom-39-s-funeral><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jennette McCurdy Talked About Mark McCurdy's Bad Behavior At Her Mom's Funeral</span></h2><h3 id=episode-4-quot-loyalty-quot-october-31st-2023>Episode 4, "Loyalty," October 31st 2023</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jennette-mccurdy-smiling.jpg><p>It's fair to say that Jennette McCurdy's mom's behavior has affected how she thinks about the other family that she has. In the fourth episode of Hard Feelings, Jennette McCurdy explained that she was meditating on the concept of "loyalty." She said that she decided to stop talking to her father and grandmother and that she doesn't agree with being loyal to people just because they have been in her life. She said that loyalty says "Hey, because we have history, we need a present and a future" but she doesn't believe that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>McCurdy continued that Mark McCurdy asked for her mother's high school friend Karen's phone number at her mom Debra McCurdy's funeral.

She talked about the possibility of freezing her eggs at one appointment and said, "It was one of the scariest doctor health experiences of my life..." McCurdy shared that while she doesn't think that she is interested in having children, she wants to leave room for her future self to feel differently.</p><p>While McCurdy didn't explain on the podcast that this is because of her mom, she previously explained herself a bit more. According to Buzzfeed, she said in a Red Table Talk interview in 2022, "I would never want to have a child for my own identity." It sounds like this is what her mom did to her, which was awful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>How Expensive Is Egg Freezing?
