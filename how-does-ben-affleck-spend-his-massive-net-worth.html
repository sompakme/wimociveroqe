But what does Mr. <strong>Affleck</strong> like to purchase while perusing the isles? Ben has been known to purchase very extravagant items (an example of such would be his $2500 bathroom rug back in 2012) with his impressive fortune. Let's take a look at what Ben likes to put some of his hard-earned moolah down on.</p><h2 id=ben-affleck-39-s-car-collection><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ben Affleck's Car Collection</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Ben</strong> has a fondness for slick, curvaceous bodies. Alright, enough of the double entendres. Affleck has amassed a beautiful fleet of luxury automobiles over the years. The Batman V Superman star has collected gems of all shapes, sizes and purposes. Ben’s Lexus RX (<strong>$43 thousand</strong>) is perfect for driving the kids to school and the like, while the bad boys of his collection such as the Chevrolet Chevelle SS (<strong>$58 thousand</strong>), the Mercedes-Benz S63 AMG (<strong>$151 thousand</strong>), and the Audi S8 (<strong>$153 thousand</strong>) are ideal for speed and style. Ben also happens to care about the environment, so it's only fitting that he has a Tesla Model S (<strong>$150 thousand</strong>) in his collection.</p><h2 id=ben-affleck-and-jennifer-garner-39-s-17-55-million-mansion><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ben Affleck And Jennifer Garner's $17.55 Million Mansion</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in 2009, <strong>Ben Affleck</strong> and <strong>Jennifer Garner</strong> were still a happily married couple. Together, the couple purchased the Los Angeles mansion for <strong>$17 million</strong>. Before completion of the luxury estate, <strong>Affleck</strong> was with Garner on the east coast. Garner finished a promotional tour for her film Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, while Affleck wrapped filming of The Company Man. Upon wrapping, the couple flew back to L.A. where their finished estate greeted them with open arms… err, doors.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez And Ben Affleck Reportedly Went Trick-Or-Treating With His Ex</a></span></p><h2 id=a-pacific-palisades-mansion-that-cost-19-25-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>A Pacific Palisades Mansion That Cost $19.25 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>How much space does one need? 12,853-square-feet? That’s how much<strong> Affleck’s</strong> Pacific Palisades mansion covers. Coming in at a hefty <strong>$19 million</strong> and change, Ben’s palace in the Palisades is massive, luxurious and close to the mother of his children. Indeed, <strong>Jennifer Garner</strong> is but a mile away, which surely makes co-parenting much easier when not having to traverse too far. Affleck’s property covers nearly one-third of an acre and boasts seven bedrooms and six full and two half bathrooms spread out over three levels.</p><h2 id=ben-affleck-39-s-bmw-s1000rr-motorcycle><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ben Affleck's BMW S1000RR Motorcycle</span></h2><p>When speeding around the streets of Los Angeles,<strong> Ben</strong> can be seen piloting his <strong>BMW S1000RR</strong>. The red, white and blue bike comes in at $16 thousand and change. This is pretty much pocket money for a man worth over <strong>$100 million</strong>. With a maximum torque of 83 lb-ft at 11,000 rpm and a torque curve of at least 74 lb-ft over a range of 5,500 to 14,500 (rpm), <strong>Affleck</strong> can speed up and down Hollywood Boulevard in style. Affleck does have a noteworthy custom <strong>BMW </strong>in his arsenal, but that was a gift and thus doesn't count.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Fans Tried To Break-Up Ben Affleck And Ana De Armas</a></span></p><h2 id=ben-affleck-39-s-lsquo-big-house-rsquo-in-savannah><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Ben Affleck's ‘Big House’ In Savannah</span></h2><p>Located in beautiful (albeit muggy) Savannah, Ben purchased<strong> ‘The Big House’ </strong>back in 2003, while <strong>‘Bennifer’ </strong>round 1 was in effect. The breathtaking Hampton Island residence spans 87 acres and is built in the style of an old plantation house. The three-home property originally cost the Justice League actor $7.1 million; however,<strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Affleck</a></strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> is in the process of selling the estate for $8.9 million, even slashing the price to ensure a sale.</a></p><h2 id=45-thousand-foundrae-necklace-for-jennifer-lopez><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>$45 Thousand Foundrae Necklace For Jennifer Lopez</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>‘Bennifer’</strong> 2.1 is upon us and despite the couple's quirks (<a href=#>such as engaging in PDA while masked</a> and<a href=#> J-Lo posing for selfies inside Affleck's car</a>), fans have embraced the couple once again. With the reformation of the extravagant couple comes extravagant gift-giving, and Ben certainly delivered with a<strong> $45 thousand Foundrae necklace</strong> he gifted <strong>J-Lo</strong>. The necklace includes key and heart pendants, as well as charms that symbolize a compass, karma, passion. Happy Birthday, indeed.</p><h2 id=1-2-million-pink-diamond-engagement-ring-for-jennifer-lopez><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>$1.2 Million Pink Diamond Engagement Ring For Jennifer Lopez</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the reformation of <strong>‘Bennifer’</strong> being in full effect, <a href=#>there have been reports of Affleck browsing at rings for <strong>J-Lo</strong></a>. Jennifer Lopez is no stranger to the prospect of engagement with Mr.<strong> Affleck</strong>; back in the early 2000s, the “Jenny From the Block” singer was gifted a<strong> $1.2 million pink diamond engagement ring </strong>when Ben first proposed. With Ben now looking through the jewelry aisles, it may be only a matter of time before he pops the question once again.</p><h2 id=85-million-mansion-with-jennifer-lopez><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>$85 Million Mansion (With Jennifer Lopez)</span></h2><p>Ben certainly seems to have an affinity for real estate and once again <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Pearl Harbor actor, along with J-Lo, has his eyes on another stunning property</a>. Located in<strong> Beverly Hills</strong>, this beautiful 38,000 square foot mansion covers 5.2 acres and features an indoor sports complex with basketball, pickleball, boxing ring, and a complete gym. With 12 bedrooms, 24 bathrooms and a caretaker as well as guard house, this house is more of a modern-day castle than a house.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Truth About Ben Affleck And Ana De Armas’ Phone Breakup</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnqZdlrOnuMScomaroJq7pXnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5yZ6lp6GWmr9us8CrpZ6qXZ%2Byr7rIn5yrZZykvabGjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
