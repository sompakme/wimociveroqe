While critics like to point out the number of people Swift has dated, it really is no different from most other people if their dating timeline was revisited from high school age through their thirties. The only difference is that Swift's relationships play out publicly rather than privately.</p><p>While Swift does not speak about her romances with any frequency, she does put them in her songs. Be it for being in love, heartbreak, and everything in between, Swift's <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong> is how she processes the emotions she has for the men she loves or loved, as seen by the songs <a href=#>Swift sings that leave her in tears on stage</a>. Swift puts her all into her relationships and allows herself to fall in love unapologetically. This is something that has led to great love and great heartbreak, as well as some unforgettable songs along the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Travis Kelce’s Reaction To Taylor Swift’s New Album Revealed As She Calls Multiple People Out ">Travis Kelce’s Reaction To Taylor Swift’s New Album Revealed As She Calls Multiple People Out</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>If Kelce has a problem with Taylor writing about past relationships, he's keeping it to himself.</p><p>While Swifties know how many boyfriends Taylor Swift has really had, the media has linked Swift to men she was never involved with. This is clear by the fact that they are not referenced in any songs, as those who have been linked to Swift know all too well that they likely will be on an album down the road, which is not only cathartic for Swift but allows fans a glimpse into what made some relationships work and what caused them to end.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-has-had-12-confirmed-boyfriends>Taylor Swift Has Had 12 (Confirmed) Boyfriends</h2><h3 id=from-her-teenage-years-through-her-thirties-taylor-swift-has-had-12-high-profile-boyfriends>From her teenage years through her thirties, Taylor Swift has had 12 high-profile boyfriends</h3><p>The world started paying attention to who Swift was dating when she was 18 years old. While the media likes to make a big deal out of how many people Swift has been in a relationship with, when broken down between her teens and thirties, the number is not large at all.</p><p>It is the fact that the people whom Swift has dated are public figures themselves; the interest in the relationship is multiplied several times or more, depending on the level of fame Swift's boyfriend has achieved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the fact that dating high-profile people means more media attention, this has never deterred <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift from following her heart</a>.

You have to forget about what everyone else thinks. It has to be an us-against-the-world mentality. You have to make it work by prioritizing it, and by falling in love really fast, without thinking too hard. If I think too hard about a relationship I'll talk myself out of it," Swift explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I have rules for a lot of areas of my life. Love is not going to be one of them."</p><p>Because of this mentality, Swift has dated some of entertainment's who's who.

The media attention on the two was constant.</p><p>The relationship with Jonas lasted from July 2008 to October 2008.</p><p>According to Swift, the relationship ended because Jonas became interested in someone else.

It was not done face to face or even by having a conversation over the phone.
