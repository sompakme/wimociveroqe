He didn’t want to come out, and he loved being up in there. He was super cozy, and I ended up having to have a C-section. It was a really hard labor, but I know other moms have it worse and we’re happy. We’re healthy. I’m grateful.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Floribama Shore returns to MTV Thursday, September 16, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGanoZyorm680aiumqakYra0ecGaq62kmaO0brzOrKupmaKpwq55w56nq52jqLawuoyapbGhlanGcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
