Zelenskyy's speech this evening: "Our diplomatic marathon continues without a break ‚Äì since my visit to Washington in December. A tank coalition has already been created for Ukraine,‚Ä¶" ‚Äì Official full video! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/PgvLrvfXfo</a></p>‚Äî D√©nes T√∂rteli üá™üá∫üá≠üá∫üá∫üá¶ (@DenesTorteli) <a href=#>February 17, 2023</a><p>The clip shows two Ukrainian soldiers in the trench fighting against an unknown number of Russian troops.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the Ukrainian soldiers shoots and seemingly injures a Russian soldier who attempts to capture the trench.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ukrainian soldier, known as the ‚ÄòLost Generation,‚Äô was a member of the 22nd ‚ÄòKharkiv‚Äô Separate Mechanized Battalion of the 92nd Mechanized Infantry Brigade.&nbsp;</p><p>This group has been particularly active in defending northeastern Ukraine, including the liberation of Balaklia and Kupyansk during the Kharkiv counter-offensive.</p><p>Using a GoPro camera attached to his helmet, he captured five minutes of continuous combat as he frantically defended his trench from Russian infantry and armor.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the video, he can be heard breathing heavily as he moves back and forth along the trench to guard his flanks and avoid staying too long in one firing position.&nbsp;</p><p>The trench was well constructed with a bend to contain the blast if a shell or grenade landed inside. The lip of the trench was lined with foliage and brambles to conceal its shape from attackers.</p><p>About 20 videos geolocated by <a href=#>CNN </a>show basic tactical blunders in an open and flat area where Ukrainian spotters on higher ground can direct artillery strikes and where minefields are worsening Russian casualties.&nbsp;</p><p>One video shows a tank exploding into a minefield, followed almost obliviously by an infantry fighting vehicle that suffers the same fate.&nbsp;</p><p>Others show Ukrainian drones dropping small explosive charges on static tanks in open country ‚Äì and a graveyard of abandoned armor.</p><p>At least two dozen Russian tanks and infantry vehicles have been disabled or destroyed in a matter of days, according to the videos released by the Ukrainian military and analyzed by military experts.</p><p>Satellite images show intensive patterns of impacts along tree lines where Russian tanks tried to advance.</p><p>Ukraine has also released extraordinary video footage that shows Russian fighters dragging their badly wounded commander away from the battlefield and beating him violently with what appears to be a shovel.&nbsp;</p><p>A Ukrainian drone captured the incident near the eastern city of Bakhmut, where intense fighting has been raging for months.&nbsp;</p><p>Four soldiers from Russia‚Äôs Wagner mercenary group carry their colleague through a landscape of ruined houses, holding his arms and legs, dumping him next to a barn.&nbsp;</p><p>A second video shows three men hitting him repeatedly with shovels.&nbsp;</p><p>The fate of the injured commander is unclear. But the episode tallies with persistent reports of low morale among Russian mercenary units.&nbsp;</p><p>Ukrainian soldiers fighting in and around Bakhmut is how Wagner troops attack in waves.&nbsp;</p><p>They are reportedly threatened with execution if they fail to advance and are mown down in large numbers, their corpses littering the frontlines.</p><p>Ukraine‚Äôs president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukrainian units were repelling repeated Russian attempts to encircle Bakhmut and break through its defenses.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>‚ÄúWe are countering them. I am grateful to every warrior who ensures counter-action with his resilience,‚Äù </strong>he declared.&nbsp;</p><p>Zelenskiy said he had discussed the key issue of ammunition supply in a meeting on Monday with his army staff.</p><p>Russian military bloggers are calling the situation a fiasco.&nbsp;</p><p>Ukrainian military drones have recorded these scenes over the past two weeks around the town of Vuhledar in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, where successive Russian assaults have failed.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCtjK%2BgnZ2fYrynedGuqqyhkaN6tLvLnaCeql2brqq4yKeeZqyfYrCivNOuqZ5lpKeyr6%2FHZq6epqRiw6q%2BwKVm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
