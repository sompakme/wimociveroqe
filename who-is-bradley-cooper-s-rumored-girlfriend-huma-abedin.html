She noted, “The number of nights that ended with work, when I’d collapsed into bed, then go back to the office to send more emails…A good life is a balanced life. I wish I’d allowed myself to experiment.”</p><p>She is definitely looking forward to what life has to offer now, and perhaps, it includes <a href=#>movie star Bradley Cooper</a> in the list.
