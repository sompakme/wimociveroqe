A 12-year-old shouldn’t have a stress rash on their head that makes them bald, but I did.”</p><p>Now, the Nickelodeon star is getting more and more comfortable with her looks and style.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Last week, Siwa shocked fans when she arrived at the Dolby Theatre for the iHeartRadio Music Awards on April 1 wearing a mesh catsuit adorned with black beaded embroidery made to look like flames.

For glam, Siwa rocked a goth-inspired dark lip and had black stars painted around her eyes — just as <strong>Gene Simmons</strong> and his Kiss bandmates did in the ’70s. The only thing missing was the white face paint.</p><p>Simmons, 74, was a fan of the look, telling<a href=# rel=noopener> TMZ, </a>“JoJo is cool. Anybody who doesn’t get it is just jealous, period. Never be ordinary. Always be extraordinary. JoJo is extraordinary and she looks cool. She looks like me, but that’s another story.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5%2B8q7uMrKCwmV2Wsa6106xkrKCVYrWiv4ysp56mpGKCcXyPaWScp6OisrW1wmaqrqqXmr%2B6ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
