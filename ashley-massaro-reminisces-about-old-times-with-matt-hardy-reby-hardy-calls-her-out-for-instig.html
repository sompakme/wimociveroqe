According to <a href=#>Reby Hardy</a>, Massaro showed up at Matt Hardy’s home in 2011 during the height of Matt Hardy’s personal battle with addiction. In a move that would anger many, Massaro apparently waited until Reby was out of town to show up at the family home with pills. Massaro’s seemingly innocent tweet set Reby Hardy off, who reminded the former WWE Diva of what she told her the ‘last time we spoke,’ and even added, ‘Bit*h FOH. u may be running the Jesus gimmick these days but I don’t forget shit.’ Ashley Massaro is a self-proclaimed</p><p>Reby Hardy’s tweet appears below:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Last time we spoke I said I’d knock u on ya ass on sight & u wanna pop up with “hOpE ur fAm iS aMaziNg” like u think I forgot u tried to come over here w pills while I was out of town in ‘11 ? Bitch FOH. u may be running the Jesus gimmick these days but I don’t forget shit.</p><p>— Reby Hardy (@RebyHardy) <a href=#>November 8, 2018</a></p><p>That’s when Massaro retweeted Hardy and responded with some fighting words of her own including the zinger of all zingers, ‘Bless ur heart darlin’:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sit down Reby, was living in NY in 2011 n nowhere near NC-there was no ‘aw precious moments’ here-I simply stated I found a cd from 2005 Matt made frm BACK IN THE DAY! No nostalgia!Bless ur heart darlin’-Just u.getting rowdy.per usual.n ps knock my a$$ on site?BAHAHA ya ok-growup <a href=#>https://t.co/spFt0VaiIY</a></p><p>— ☆ Ashley Massaro ☆ (@ashleymassaro11) <a href=#>November 8, 2018</a></p><p>None of this was sitting well with Reby Hardy, who in turn accused Massaro of looking for ‘attention’:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Of course you RT for everyone to see lmao…You getting that attention you were looking for booboo ? Yet you want me to *sit down* while you out here publicly reminiscing bout someone else’s husband AFTER ALL YOUR SHADY BULLSHIT ? I know damn right where you was in ‘11…</p><p>— Reby Hardy (@RebyHardy) <a href=#>November 8, 2018</a></p><p>Hardy also added the following, letting Massaro know that when she brought up the family, the gloves came off:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>You could’ve gone on with your instigatingass tweet & I would ignored it like every other damn time you’ve mentioned him, but the moment you mention “the fam” is the moment you’re gonna get called out. Fakeass.</p><p>— Reby Hardy (@RebyHardy) <a href=#>November 8, 2018</a></p><p>Hardy wasn’t done there. She even compared Massaro to a ‘herpes sore’ that ‘pops up every few yrs’:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>…cuz I have screenshots of u asking for flights. Do I need to dig up the iphone4 ? ur crustyass pops up every few yrs like a fuckin herpes sore it’s played out. “Grow up” LOL nah bitch I’m good. Try that bigger person pseudo mature bullshit with someone else I’ll fuckin pop u</p><p>— Reby Hardy (@RebyHardy) <a href=#>November 8, 2018</a></p><p>Massaro has not yet replied to the ‘herpes sore’ comparison.</p><p>While Reby Hardy may come off as harsh and overprotective to some, her recent tweets should be kept in perspective and in light of Matt Hardy’s struggles with addiction. Matt Hardy recently credited his wife with playing an instrumental role in getting him off the path of self-destruction.</p><p>During a recent appearance on <a href=#>Lilian Garcia</a>‘s <a href=#>show</a>, Matt Hardy gave Reby <a href=#>credit</a> with helping him get clean:</p><p>When I was going through my darkest days, she was the one where other people probably wouldn’t have, she didn’t care about any wrestler or any level of fame. None of that makes any difference at all. She could care less. Everybody to her is just like a person. When I was going through my darkest days, she stayed on my ass all the time about stuff and for that, I will always love her and I’ll always appreciate her. It’s a debt I’ll always [unintelligible] because not a lot of people would. Some people would either get frustrated and leave, but she was there….she was on it. She staid on my ass the whole while and that helped me get through those days. She was heavily responsible for that. That’s one of those things, looking back in hindsight, if I didn’t have a personality as strong and as powerful and as truculent as her, I don’t know if I would have made it through in the same way.</p><p>Matt Hardy also noted:</p><p>Knowing that I had to change and my wife staying on my ass. That was it. You are just forced to because you’re gonna start losing things. Having somebody that was looking over my shoulder and on my ass, I credit her with that more than anything else. She was just on my ass non-stop. If you are in that state of just trying to get things together and you don’t have someone overseeing you with an eagle eye, it’s very easy to slip and slide right back into what you’re doing, so that’s what I credit her with more than anything else.</p><p>Reby Hardy also added the following to her Twitter account:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Seems like I dislike a lot of people for “no reason”, huh ? Lemme make it clear: there is ALWAYS a reason. And reason #1 is almost always bc someone enabled, encouraged or supplied drugs to my family. They will NEVER not be called out for it & I will never forget that.</p><p>— Reby Hardy (@RebyHardy) <a href=#>November 8, 2018</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Maybe now some of you geniuses can put the pieces together.</p><p>— Reby Hardy (@RebyHardy) <a href=#>November 8, 2018</a></p><h2 class=xe-gallery__title>Matt Reby Maxel Wolfgang Hardy Senor Benjamin</h2><ul class=xe-gallery__items><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>The Hardy Family</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/12/ashley-massaro.jpg></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>The Hardy Family</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/gallery/matt-reby-maxel-wolfgang-hardy-senor-benjamin/hardy-clan.jpg></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>The Hardy Family</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/gallery/matt-reby-maxel-wolfgang-hardy-senor-benjamin/hardy-family-2.jpg></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--ad"></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>"Woken" Matt Hardy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/gallery/matt-reby-maxel-wolfgang-hardy-senor-benjamin/hardy-family.jpg></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>"Woken" Matt Hardy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/gallery/matt-reby-maxel-wolfgang-hardy-senor-benjamin/matt-hardy-3.jpg></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>"Woken" Matt Hardy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/gallery/matt-reby-maxel-wolfgang-hardy-senor-benjamin/matt-hardy-broken-1.jpg></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--ad"></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>Matt Hardy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/gallery/matt-reby-maxel-wolfgang-hardy-senor-benjamin/matt-hardy-broken-2.jpg></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>"Woken" Matt Hardy & Vanguard-1</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/gallery/matt-reby-maxel-wolfgang-hardy-senor-benjamin/matt-hardy-ladders.jpg></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--image"><h3 class=xe-gallery__item-title>Reby, Maxel & Wolfgang Hardy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/gallery/matt-reby-maxel-wolfgang-hardy-senor-benjamin/matt-hardy-vanguard-1.jpg></li><li class="xe-gallery__item xe-gallery__item--ad"></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfY9qb3FwZWK%2Fpq7YZp%2BaqpSueqK%2Fx6WcsmWdlsC0rdGoZKaZpKl6qa3RnbA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
