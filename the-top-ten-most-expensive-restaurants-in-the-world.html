Some would settle for fast food, while others would opt for fine dining. But if you really want to indulge yourself, these are the restaurants that you must try at least once in your lifetime. The prices in these restaurants are enough reason to make you savor each and every bite.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-masa-in-new-york---450><strong>1. Masa in New York - $450</strong></h2><p>Located at the Time Warner Center in New York, Masa is the most expensive restaurant in the fashionable mall in one of the world’s biggest city. The chef himself will welcome you, as he does to every guest who enters the restaurant’s wooden door. The restaurant can accommodate up to 26 guests at a time, and this exclusive clientele will be treated to Masa’s specialties, like its foie gras hotpot and wild watercress tempura. The fish used by the chef are all flown in from Japan. Truffles and other expensive exotic ingredients are also used.

Aragawa in Tokyo - $368</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is a renowned steak house that offers only six tables, which underlines its exclusivity.&nbsp; There is no written menu in this restaurant. The waiter would simply recite the chef’s selections for the day, and you would be asked to choose two seafood appetizers from five available items. The steak would then be served, and no, you need not choose which part you prefer and how you would like it cooked. Aragawa has already chosen the best part, and though it would depend on the condition of the cow, it is usually a sirloin and cooked medium rare. The meat is scorched on the outside, while the center is a tender red. Only salt and pepper are used to bring out the meat’s natural flavors. Aragawa’s steak will make a vegetarian renounce his beliefs.</p><h2 id=3-solo-per-due-in-umbria---318><strong>3. Solo Per Due in Umbria - $318</strong></h2><p>Solo Per Due restaurant redefines the meaning of the word exclusivity. How exclusive?

The quaint restaurant in a 19th century building features an entrance spruced up with candlelight. Appetizers are served either in the vine garden or in front of a log fire, depending on the season. The restaurant specializes in local cuisine. You can take your time eating because the waiters will not be bothering you that much; they will wait for you to ring a silver bell before showing up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-ithaa-in-maldives---300><strong>4. Ithaa in Maldives - $300</strong></h2><p>Ithaa is the world’s first underwater restaurant, as it is located 5 meters below sea level. The entrance is grand in itself, as you will go down a spiral staircase. The restaurant only has 14 seats, so be sure to get a reservation. It specializes in seafood and Western cuisine with a local touch. You can enjoy Ithaa’s meal that is 23 courses long while being surrounded by sea creatures on all sides. Be prepared to see sharks, rays and schools of fish swimming around the area looking at you while you are gorging on food.</p><h2 id=5-french-laundry-in-napa-valley---270><strong>5.

El Amparo in Madrid - $122</strong></h2><p>An excellent restaurant in the capital of Spain, El Amparo has an extremely good and long Iberian Peninsula wine collection. The cold salmon with tomato sorbet and chocolate soufflé are must-tries. While the food served here are not really creative, they are all presented and executed perfectly.
