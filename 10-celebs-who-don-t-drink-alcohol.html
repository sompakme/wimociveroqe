Whenever people are meeting up to hang out and have fun, the one question that’s always asked is, “Who’s bringing the drinks?” When you’re a celeb, high profile social gatherings are the norm, and every night is filled with all kinds of parties and soirees where you can choose to get drunk, high and indulge whatever vice you want. &nbsp;In this type of environment, it’s easy to go overboard and become an addict or an alcoholic, so some celebs have just made the choice to abstain from alcohol completely.&nbsp; Below is a list of ten celebs that have chosen a life of total sobriety. See below ….</p><h2 id=blake-lively><strong>Blake Lively:</strong></h2><p>The 27-yr-old <a title="Blake Lively Net Worth" href=#>Blake Lively</a> rose to fame in the popular CW show Gossip Girl. She has gone on to appear in other hit movies like The Town and Savages. She married the handsome Canadian actor <a title="Ryan Reynolds Net Worth" href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a> in 2012, and the two of them are actually expecting a child together. Blake is also a lifelong teetotaler. In an interview with Allure magazine, she offered the following quote, “I don’t drink. I’ve never tried a drug – it’s just something that I genuinely don’t have a desire for.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=bradley-cooper><strong>Bradley Cooper:</strong></h2><p>Actor <a title="Bradley Cooper Net Worth" href=#>Bradley Cooper</a> is presently one of the top leading men in Hollywood. He’s had a string of very successful Hollywood movies including Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle and the Clint Eastwood directed American Sniper dropping this winter. However you’ll be surprised to know that the star of The Hangover movies actually doesn’t drink. In an interview with GQ magazine, the 39-yr-old actor mentioned that he stopped drinking at the age of 29. His exact quote was: “If I continued it, I was really going to sabotage my life.”</p><p></p><h2 id=edie-falco><strong>Edie Falco:</strong></h2><p>If you’ve ever watched the cable show, Nurse Jackie, then you know that sobriety is the last thing that comes to mind when you think about the talented actress <a title="Edie Falco Net Worth" href=#>Edie Falco</a>. On the show, she plays a serious drug addict that somehow manages to keep things together with her family and hospital duties. However in real life, the former Sopranos star has been sober for 21 years. When the New York Post asked her about her sobriety, she answered that: “It’s like learning to ride a bike, you know? You have to get your bearings and you have to stay stable. And balanced.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=eminem><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Eminem: &nbsp;</strong></h2><p>There was a time at the beginning of his career when the rapper <a title="Eminem Net Worth" href=#>Eminem</a> was all about drugs, alcohol and living recklessly. It was an image that tapped directly into the angst of disillusioned white suburban kids. He rode that persona to global success, but nowadays, he’s a grown man and his lifestyle has completely switched up. In a recent interview with Vibe magazine about one of his more recent albums, he said, “You gotta remember, I hadn’t recorded a song sober in seven years. So it took me a while to even feel like I could record a song sober.” As any Eminem fan will tell you, the new Eminem stuff is sounding just as good as the older music, so sobriety has definitely been a good choice for him.</p><p></p><h2 id=jennifer-lopez><strong>Jennifer Lopez:</strong></h2><p>At the age of 45, <a title="Jennifer Lopez Net Worth" href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a> aka J-Lo is looking hotter than ever. It’s 2014, but from the way she looks, you would think that she’s still a fly girl on In Living Color, or the early days when she had the hot 2001 track, “Jenny from the Block.” Her new track “Booty” featuring Iggy Azalea is getting millions of YouTube views and lately, she revealed one of the secrets to her eternal fountain of youth (and it has to do with alcohol). “I think that [alcohol] ruins your skin,” she told InStyle magazine. She continued, “Of course, during celebratory toasts, everybody’s like, ‘you can’t toast with water!’ So I’ll toast with alcohol and just take a sip.”&nbsp;So now we know – you want to stay young forever, stay away from the liquor!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=colin-farrell><strong>Colin Farrell:</strong></h2><p>When <a title="Colin Farrell Net Worth" href=#>Colin Farrell</a> first exploded on the scene, he was known mostly for his acting prowess, good looks and his love for partying. There were even times in his heavy partying days when he was linked to young starlets like Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan. But those days are long gone for Mr. Farrell. In a recent interview with Ellen he explained how he has been sober for many years now: “I’m seven years sober, “he said. “I’m really grateful. It’s really lovely to be present in my life. I was terrified of being sober because, I’m not saying I was a great actor before or a great actor since, but I was terrified that whatever my capacity was as an actor beforehand would completely disappear.” Well, he has been cast as one of the stars in the new season of True Detective, so his acting skills are probably just fine.</p><p></p><h2 id=pharrell><strong>Pharrell:</strong></h2><p>There is no doubt about it – in the realm of music and fashion lifestyle, <a title="Pharrell Williams Net Worth" href=#>Pharrell Williams</a> is definitely considered the epitome of cool. His music career, after being in the game for about 20 years, is bigger than ever before, and he has his hand in all types of high profile art and fashion projects. One would think that with such a glamorous life, he’d be living a rock star life too, but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. In an interview with Paper magazine some years back, he stated that, “Everyone else can do what they want, but that stuff isn’t for me. I’ve been drunk nine times in my life, and I ate some weed brownies once.” That’s quite impressive, don’t you think? He’s certainly a great example for all the kids out there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=ben-affleck><strong>Ben Affleck:</strong></h2><p><a title="Ben Affleck Net Worth" href=#>Ben Affleck</a>’s Hollywood career just keeps on ascending from one level to the next. His new movie Gone Girl is doing exceptionally well at The Box Office, and he’s gearing up to suit up as Batman in the highly anticipated Batman Vs. Superman film currently in production. Affleck is also an actor who’s completely sober. This is what he told The Mirror, “Simple as this, I quit drinking. It’s really not that big a deal. When you are in your 20s, you’re not married, you’re having fun. As you grow older you have more responsibilities and you have to step up to them.”&nbsp; Well said Mr. Affleck, well said.</p><p></p><h2 id=kelly-osbourne><strong>Kelly Osbourne:</strong></h2><p>Growing up in a house with a dad like <a title="Ozzy Osbourne Net Worth" href=#>Ozzy Osbourne</a>, it’s easy to see how a daughter or son would grow up with a ton of alcohol or drug problems. And that was exactly the case with <a title="Kelly Osbourne Net Worth" href=#>Kelly Osbourne</a>. In an interview with <a title="Anderson Cooper Net Worth" href=#>Anderson Cooper</a> in 2012, she confessed that: “I had been to rehab several times and reached a point where I was taking more of what I was doing in hopes that I wouldn’t wake up. And the next morning when I woke up, ‘I just prayed for death – and I was like, what the hell is wrong with me?’” That was her rock bottom and she has been totally sober ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=kat-von-d><strong>Kat Von D:</strong></h2><p>There’s a lot of truth to the common saying: “You can’t judge a book by its cover.” &nbsp;When you look at popular tattooist <a title="Kat Von D Net Worth" href=#>Kat Von D</a> and her numerous tattoos, it’s easy to think that she lives a high life filled with lots of drugs and alcohol. But the fact of the matter is that she’s completely sober and has been that way for several years. At the beginning of this year, she tweeted the following, “Today marks the 6th year of sobriety! Yay for not being a drunken a**hole!!” Congratulations to her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2Ysq2xwaxksKCfYrGwutNmm6uhnqB6orjCqJ%2BopF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
