Once they got to their destination, they realized that it wasn't what was advertised and things were, in fact, kind of disgusting.</p><p>Luckily for us, there are a lot of pictures online so we can see some of what people had to deal with. (Or maybe unluckily for us?) Here are 20 gross photos posted by people who stayed in Airbnbs.</p><h2 id=do-you-want-to-take-a-shower-here-why-not><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Do You Want To Take A Shower Here?

But you do expect your Airbnb host to actually clean up the kitchen sink before letting you stay there.</p><p>If we saw this IRL, we would probably just run away. Far, far away.

And no one could ever even think about sitting on that couch since the cushions are all messed up.</p><p>Whoever booked this Airbnb must have walked right out. It's hard to imagine someone wanting to stay here.</p><h2 id=and-this-bedroom-is-even-worse><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>And This Bedroom Is Even Worse</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019-08-19_5d5a1dc5110e3_IMG_64611.jpg><p>Speaking of Airbnbs where no one would want to stay...</p><p>An Airbnb host should absolutely make sure that the bed is actually made. There should be clean sheets, pillows, and a nice blanket or comforter. There shouldn't be a mess like whatever situation is happening here. It's too gross for words.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-definitely-want-to-see-dirty-windows><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>You Definitely Want To See Dirty Windows</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/airbnb-2.jpg><p>Imagine this: you pull up to your Airbnb, excited for your fun vacation, and you unlock the front door. You start putting your stuff away and checking out the environment... and then you lay eyes on this dirty window.</p><p>"Dirty window" isn't even the right term.

It doesn't seem like anyone would actually want to sleep in them (and if they did, it wouldn't exactly be beauty rest).</p><p>These bunk beds are so gross and they're simply hard metal with no mattresses on them. And what's even worse is that there are 22 bunk beds in this particular Airbnb.
