When Jacob Elordi and Olivia Bolton entered the picture, there was a lot of discussion about whether Zendaya and Holland had finally gotten together. But after being seen kissing in their car in the summer of 2021, Zendaya and Holland decided to go public with their love. The two are allegedly engaged, according to recent speculations. Let’s talk about Zendaya and Tom Holland’s romance and whether or not they are engaged.</span></p><h2><span>Are Zendaya And Tom Holland Still Together 2023?</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Before the release of their movie Spider-Man: No Way Home, Zendaya finally added Tom to her Instagram feed after he had already received a few admiring posts from fans of the Disney Channel alum.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“My Spider-Man, I’m so proud of you,” she said in the description of an adoring Instagram post that featured images of Tom on the set of their movie as well as images of him as a young boy dressed as <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Spider-Man</a>. It’s a good thing that certain things never change.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tom-holland-zendaya.jpg alt="are zendaya and tom holland still together 2023" width=736 height=414 sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Euphoria actress responded to Tom’s Instagram post from January 2022, which showed his images from a Prada brand campaign, just one month later.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Cherry actor titled his Instagram carousel image, “Undress with @prada,” and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Zendaya</a> replied with a slew of heart-eye emojis.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>By March 2022, Tom had left numerous comments on Zendaya’s Instagram pictures, including one from a photo shoot that she had posted on March 3. She captioned her image, “One of my all-time fave shoots,” and in the comment, her partner used three heart-eyed emojis. She posted a second professional photo of herself that day, and her boyfriend sweetly complimented her by using three fire emojis in his comment underneath.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The couple didn’t share any internet images of themselves over the following three months. On June 1, Zendaya did, however, send her boyfriend a birthday message on Instagram.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Zendaya captioned a black and white photo of them together, “Happiest of birthdays to the one that makes me the happiest &lt;3.”</span></p><p><strong>See Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>The Challenge: Are Amber And Chauncey Still Together After The Show?</a></strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/s4-6360a8525169e-1667278930.webp alt="are zendaya and tom holland still together 2023" width=762 height=495 sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tom couldn’t help but enthuse over his girlfriend’s July 2022 Vogue Italia cover just a few weeks later. The Dune actor shared a collection of breathtaking photos she took for the magazine, in which she was seen donning eye makeup that Euphoria’s character would like and modeling a magnificent, deep-cut silver sparkling outfit.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Zendaya’s boyfriend just expressed his support by using heart emojis in his comment on the breathtaking image.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>When Tom admitted in an August 2022 Instagram video that he needed to “take a break” from using social media since it was “overwhelming” for him, it seemed that some of their charming posts came to an end.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“When I read stuff about myself online, I spiral and get caught up, and it’s ultimately very bad for my mental health,” Tom said in his tape. “I, therefore, decided to back off and delete the app.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But it doesn’t mean he will stop making amorous moves toward Zendaya. A fan caught the Uncharted actress crocheting while she flew on a commercial airplane to Budapest to meet up with her while she worked on the sequel to Dune.</span></p><p><strong>See Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>Aubrey Plaza Marries Her Longtime Boyfriend, Director Jeff Baena!</a></strong></p><h2><span>Tom Holland And Zendaya Are Rumored To Be Engaged</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It came as no surprise when headlines started to surface stating that <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Tom Holland</a> and Zendaya were engaged because they appear to be as in love as ever.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The allegations have since been refuted by Zendaya’s protective mother, who put the gossip to bed. “Clickbait often refers to the practice of crafting sensationalized or deceptive headlines to generate clicks on a piece of content,” she wrote in a post on her Instagram Story. <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/zendaya-tom-ring-social-gettyimages-1358269514.jpg alt="are zendaya and tom holland still together 2023" width=760 height=572 sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Fans quickly realized that the message was alluding to the rumors that the Spider-Man actors will soon become “fiancés.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Zendaya and Tom appear to be passionate about one other despite the fake engagement rumors!
