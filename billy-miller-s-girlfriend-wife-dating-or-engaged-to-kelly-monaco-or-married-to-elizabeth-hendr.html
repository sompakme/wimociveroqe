However, his romantic life has sparked interest among fans since the news of his death.</p><p>Rumors have circulated that he was dating former General Hospital co-stars <strong>Elizabeth Hendrickson</strong> (@e.c.hendrickson) and <strong>Kelly Monaco</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>(@kellymonaco1), although neither has been officially confirmed. However, as fans grieve the tragic and unexpected death of a three-time Daytime Emmy winner, recognizing the true nature of his connection with Kelly becomes critical to appreciate their professional journey together.</p><p>Monaco and Miller, who play the beloved characters Sam Morgan and Jason Morgan, have an evident chemistry on-screen. Their portrayal is so genuine and heartfelt that viewers began to speculate about an off-screen romance. However, while their on-screen love story is apparent, both actors openly denied any off-screen romantic involvement.</p><p>The suspicion regarding Monaco and Miller’s off-screen relationship isn’t solely based on their on-screen chemistry. Observant fans have observed numerous occasions when the two have been seen together outside of the set. Their encounters, while close, lack overt romantic overtones.</p><p>Kelly has also stated in interviews that she is single, emphasizing her platonic relationship with Miller. Furthermore, the lack of any social media posts proving a love relationship from either party just adds to the mystery.</p><p>When we look into Monaco’s personal life, we find out about her previous connection with <strong>Mike Gonzalez</strong>. She hasn’t openly dated anyone since their relationship ended in 2009. On the other hand, Miller’s romantic history includes a romance with actress <strong>Kirsten Storms </strong>(@kirstenstorms). However, neither actor has indicated any romantic involvement with anyone.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=billy-millers-mother-confirms-the-cause-of-his-death></span>Billy Miller’s Mother Confirms the Cause of His Death!<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Billy Miller</strong>‘s mother, <strong>Patricia Miller</strong> has recently cleared the air about the events leading up to her son’s terrible death.
