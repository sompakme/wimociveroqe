At the top of the 77th annual ceremony, the stand-up comedian, 58, covered everything from Felicity Huffman’s involvement in the college admissions scandal to the rise of Netflix and other streaming services.
“You all look lovely, dolled up,” Gervais told the star-studded audience."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

No, shush. It’s her daughter I feel sorry for, OK? That must be the most embarrassing thing that’s ever happened to her — and her dad [<a href=#><strong>William H. Macy</strong></a>] was in Wild Hogs.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Golden-Globes-2020-Host-Ricky-Gervais-Nails-Opening-Monologue-With-Jokes-About-Cats-and-Felicity-Huffman-03.jpg><p>After saying hello to the cast of The Irishman (and jokingly mistaking <a href=#><strong>Joe Pesci</strong></a> for Baby Yoda), the Office creator changed the conversation to the lack of diversity among this year’s nominees.</p><p>“Many talented people of color were snubbed in major categories. Unfortunately, there’s nothing we can do about that. The Hollywood Foreign Press are all very, very racist,” he quipped.</p><p>Perhaps the funniest moment, however, came when Gervais talked about the Cats movie adaptation starring <a href=#><strong>James Corden</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jason Derulo</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Idris Elba</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Hudson</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ian McKellen</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Golden-Globes-2020-Host-Ricky-Gervais-Nails-Opening-Monologue-With-Jokes-About-Cats-and-Felicity-Huffman-02.jpg><p>“Some of the world got to see James Corden as a fat p–sy. He was also in the movie Cats,” he joked. “But no one saw that, and the reviews were shocking. I saw one that said, ‘This is the worst thing that has happened to cats since dogs.’ But Dame <a href=#><strong>Judi Dench</strong></a> defended the film, saying it was the role she was born to play because … she loves nothing better than plunking herself down on the carpet, lifting her leg and licking her p–sy.”</p><p>Throughout the monologue, celebrity guests including <a href=#><strong>Tom Hanks</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Carol Burnett</strong></a> were spotted cracking up at the host’s jokes. Apple CEO <strong>Tim Cook</strong>, however, looked less than thrilled when Gervais quipped that the company’s streaming service, Apple+, runs “sweat shops in China.”</p><p>The Hollywood Foreign Press Association announced in November that Gervais was set to return as the Globes host for a record fifth time. He previously led the show in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2016.</p><p>“Once again, they’ve made me an offer I can’t refuse,” the three-time Golden Globe winner said in a statement at the time. “But this is the very last time I’m doing this, which could make for a fun evening.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>HFPA president Lorenzo Soria teased in a press release that viewers “can always expect the unexpected” with Gervais at the helm, while NBC Entertainment chairman Paul Telegdy applauded the After Life star for bringing “a palpable electricity [to] the room” each time he hosts.</p><p>Watch the video above for the five best moments from Gervais’ monologue!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6opJSau26zy6iZnqtdZ31zfIyhpqysXae2pLfYZp6eqqaWtrR5w56joq6Vp8Buu8%2BepaKml2K6sLrOpaagrZVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
