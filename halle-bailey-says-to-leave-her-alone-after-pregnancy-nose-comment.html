Earlier in September, Bailey exclusively told Us Weekly that she wanted to “switch [her style] up a little bit and get out of the princessy looks” and <a href=#>lean into “baggy streetwear.”</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Halle-Bailey-Shuts-Down-Pregnancy-Nose-Comment-Inline.jpg><p>For Halloween, Bailey and DDG, 26, elected to wear casual clothing when <a href=#>they paid tribute</a> to <a href=#><strong>Janet Jackson</strong></a> and the late <a href=#>Tupac Shakur</a>’s 1993 Poetic Justice characters. In a carousel of pictures posted to her <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> account, Bailey donned a black t-shirt, black jeans and black beret while DDG sported a baseball jersey and sideways baseball cap.</p><p>The pair have been linked since January 2022, when they were spotted at <a href=#><strong>Usher</strong></a>’s residency in Las Vegas. Two months after their debut at the Usher concert, Bailey and the “Moonwalking in Calabasas” rapper made their relationship Instagram official.</p><p>But the Grown-ish actor first noticed her beau when she found his YouTube channel in 2015.</p><p>“I’ve been a fan of his for years,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>Essence</a> in November 2022. “I grew up being on YouTube and would always see the young Black creators and was constantly inspired by them. He was one of them.”</p><p>Bailey told the outlet that she “forgot about him,” but he later messaged her “and the rest is history.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In February, DDG’s ex-girlfriend <strong>Rubi Rose</strong> accused him of cheating on Halle, but the two remained together.</p><p>“Experiencing deep love for the first time in my life is something I feel has opened a whole new world for me creatively,” Bailey told British Vogue in April. “What it feels like to love someone other than your family, like somebody you may not have known two years ago but now they’re the center of your world.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGahmZyhsm6uwKKjnrFdqK66v4ytpmaklZbDpnnHnqlmmZyku6Z5wJ%2Brnqpdpb%2Bms82apZyxXaO8tLGMnKampZWjwXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
