Consisting of eight episodes, season 1 of the YA drama will serve as an update to the original film, which was based on the 1781 novel&nbsp;<i>Dangerous Liaisons</i>&nbsp;and starred <strong>Sarah Michelle Gellar</strong>, <strong>Ryan Phillippe</strong> and <strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong>.</p><p>“Cruel Intentions defined an era and is still a centerpiece in popular culture. We are excited to have [showrunners] <strong>Phoebe [Fisher]</strong> and <strong>Sara [Goodman]</strong> bring this new adaptation to life, as this has been a passion project of ours since I got to Sony,”<strong> Lauren Stein</strong>, head of creative for Sony Pictures Television, shared in a statement at the time. “We are grateful for our partners at Prime Video, Amazon MGM Studios and Original Film, who brought the movie to life over 20 years ago.”</p><p>Described as the “next chapter” to Cruel Intentions, the series will take place in Washington D.C. where&nbsp;“two ruthless step-siblings will do anything to stay on top of the cutthroat social hierarchy,” per the official description. <strong>Sarah</strong> <strong>Catherine Hook</strong>, <strong>Zac Burgess</strong> and <strong>Savannah Lee Smith</strong> will star in the lead roles.</p><p>Prime’s iteration of Cruel Intentions is not the first attempted remake. Fox filmed three episodes of a prequel series in the early 2000s, which were combined into the direct-to-video 2001 film titled Cruel Intentions 2. Three years later, Sony released Cruel Intentions 3 as a direct-to-video project. In 2016, a pilot for an NBC revival series was filmed featuring Gellar reprising her role as Kathryn Merteuil, but the drama ultimately never made it to air.</p><p>“We are so excited to get to work together to continue the legacy of Cruel Intentions, a film that remains beloved by so many — including us!“ showrunners Goodman and Fisher said in a December 2023 press release. “We promise to make this next iteration as fun, irreverent and boundary-pushing as the original, and are grateful to our partners at Original Film, Sony and Amazon MGM Studios for trusting us to keep it Cruel.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for everything to know about the Cruel Intentions TV remake:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Everything-to-Know-About-the-Cruel-Intentions-TV-Remake-2.jpg><h3>Where Can I Watch ‘Cruel Intentions’?</h3><p>Season 1, which will consist of eight episodes, will be available to stream on Prime Video, Amazon’s streaming service.</p><h3>When Does ‘Cruel Intentions’ Premiere?</h3><p>A premiere date for the series has yet to be announced.</p><h3>Who Is in the ‘Cruel Intentions’ Cast?</h3><p class=x_elementToProof>Hook, Burgess, Smith, <strong>Sara Silva</strong>, <strong>Khobe Clarke</strong>, <strong>John Harlan Kim</strong>, Brooke and <strong>Lena Johnso</strong>n will star in the YA drama, while. <strong>Claire Forlani</strong>, <strong>Nikki Crawford</strong>, <strong>Isabella Tagliati</strong>, <strong>Zeke Goodman</strong> and<strong> Jon Tenney</strong> are set to appear in recurring roles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Everything-to-Know-About-the-Cruel-Intentions-TV-Remake.jpg><h3>What Is ‘Cruel Intentions’ About?</h3><p>Described as the “next chapter” of the original 1999 film, the series will take place in Washington D.C. where&nbsp;two ruthless step-siblings will do anything to stay on top of the cutthroat social hierarchy,” per the official description. “After a brutal hazing incident threatens the entire Panhellenic system at their school, they’ll do whatever is necessary to preserve their power and reputation, even if that means seducing the daughter of the vice president of the United States.”</p><h3>Who Is Writing ‘Cruel ‘Intentions’?</h3><p>Goodman and Fisher will serve as writers and executive producers. <strong>Neal H.
