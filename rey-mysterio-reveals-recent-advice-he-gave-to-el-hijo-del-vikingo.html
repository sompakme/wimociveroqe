WWE United States Champion Rey Mysterio recently sat down with Marc Raimondi of ESPN. When asked about a recent conversation he had with El Hijo del Vikingo, Mysterio said he should slow it down a couple of beats now before injuries and surgeries give him no other choice. “So he’s actually very, very good,” Rey Mysterio said. “And I believe he was going through an injury at the time."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And I kind of connected him with the people to see if he can get his knee taken care of. But overall, I said it happened to me.</p><p>“A lot of people would tell me to slow down and I, with all due respect, would always say thank you. Yes, I will. And it would almost come in through one ear and out the other, and I wouldn’t pay attention. Obviously, until you start going through injuries and surgeries, you’re not slowing down because they’re telling you you’re slowing down because now you need to because you can’t risk your body anymore, as you did.</p><h2 id=h-rey-mysterio-learned-the-hard-way>Rey Mysterio learned the hard way</h2><p>“So, I pretty much gave him that advice and told him that he can still be incredible if he just toned it down two beats more. Sometimes, three beats more. Pick the moments on where you want to do your things that will impact. You don’t have to do it every night because they already know who you are. I hope that he takes the advice and not have to suffer what I did, which I learned the hard way.”</p><p><a href=#>Rey Mysterio Says He Will Have A Face-To-Face With Logan Paul On 10/20 SmackDown</a></p><p>What do you make of Rey Mysterio’s comments?
