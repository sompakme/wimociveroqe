His groundbreaking work in music, television, and film established him as among Black culture's most powerful figures, opening the path for other futurists to continue in his footsteps. He was hip-hop but in a handmade tuxedo, and he was always dressed to impress.</p><p>Andre Harrell was an inventive music businessman who launched Uptown Records in the late 1980s, a vital link between the realms of hip-hop and R&B. Harrell was the one who gave Sean Combs his first break, making him <a href=#>one of hip hop's behemoths and global ambassadors</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Andre Harrell's untimely death on May 9, 2020 shocked the music industry.

But his musical perspective wasn't necessarily the same as his colleagues'; he sought a touch of elegance and a style that could appeal to both older and younger generations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Andre Harrell established a place for performers that fused hip-hop bravado with conventional R&B finesse, who had both a smooth texture and harsh edges when he started Uptown Records in 1986. It was among the most musically significant and commercially successful record companies in the US for about a decade.</p><p>Uptown was quickly successful, and in 1988, they formed a relationship with MCA, a big record company. Uptown was among the most consistent hit makers in the music biz by the early 1990s. It also introduced two of the most important R&B performers of the 1990s and beyond: Jodeci, a four-man vocal group that merged raw vitality with church-trained emotion, and Mary J. Blige, who refined her calloused grief and went on to become one of spirit music's greatest talents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harrell could have staked a claim in helping to create two styles of Black music that would go on to affect the industry for the next three decades and beyond.</p><p>Mary J. Blige is unquestionably among the most influential figures in hip-hop soul and the music world, as well as one of Harrell's talent scouts.
