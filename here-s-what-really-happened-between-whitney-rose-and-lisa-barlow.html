While Meredith Marks and Jen Shah are finally putting their beef behind them, it seems as if Whitney and Lisa's feud is taking precedence. It's no surprise that Lisa's relationship with Whitney is still convoluted, however, there doesn't seem to be an end in sight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The VIDA owner has been in a <a href=#>feud with Whitney and Heather</a> since season one, and it's definitely trickled into their second go. During tonight's episode, Lisa and Whitney finally have their very first sit-down, and while it appeared to have gone over well, it's evident that these two are just not meant to be friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Is 'RHOSLC' Newbie, Jennie Nguyen Worth?</a></span></p><p>That became clear when Lisa was called out for allegedly <a href=#>sabotaging Angie's casino fundraiser</a>, all over being friends with Whitney. With things being so volatile when it comes to their friendship or lack thereof, fans are wondering where this all started, and what exactly the issue at hand is.</p><h2 id=whitney-and-lisa-barlow-39-s-feud>Whitney And Lisa Barlow's Feud</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Whitney Rose and Lisa Barlow were first introduced to fans during RHOSLC's first season, they instantly thought the two would dominate the show together. Although Whitney and Lisa are the duo we totally deserved but never got, it seems as if viewers can say goodbye to that idea altogether.</p><p>Whitney was quick to let Lisa know that she felt very dismissed, put down, and judged by Lisa, all of which Barlow denied instantly. Things went from bad to worse this season, and now, it seems as if <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their feud is reaching an all-time high.</a> Rose has clearly been looking into Lisa's faults with a magnifying glass, which hasn't done wonders for her frustrations when it comes to constantly being ignored and belittled by Barlow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, it seems as if Mary Cosby hit the nail on the head when she spilled the tea, and boy was it ever hot! “Whitney is seeking validation from Lisa, and Whitney wants to be Lisa’s friend," Cosby shared, and well, she seems to be onto something! Viewers have pointed out that Whitney seeks approval from Lisa, and it's become clear that Lisa doesn't even want to give her the time of day.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'RHOSLC': Here's Why Fans Are Tired Of Brooks Marks</a></span></p><h2 id=lisa-never-intended-to-hurt-whitney>Lisa Never Intended To Hurt Whitney</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Turns out, Whitney's suspicions when it came to Lisa not liking her were true! When it was discovered that Rose and 'friend of' star, Angie Harrington were actually cousins, Barlow texted Angie to not "claim her" as her cousin, all while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">calling the two "inbred"</a>. Ouch! Lisa went on to make matters worse when she referred to Whitney as "this" rather than calling her by name.</p><p>Well, Whitney made sure to point all of this out during their sit down in tonight's episode, however, Lisa avoided all accountability, and simply claimed that being horrible to Whitney was "never her intention." Although Whitney was quick to forgive Lisa, she made it clear that she still has a lot to see in order to be able to move on from it all.</p><h2 id=where-do-whitney-and-lisa-stand-today>Where Do Whitney And Lisa Stand Today?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Whitney and Lisa's sit down seemed promising, the two are by no means friends today! Lisa had told Whitney that she considers her a friend, however, Whitney's perception of their relationship was that they were not friends. Well, not only is that still true, but Whitney seems to be reaching a resolution on her own.</p><p>"My only problem with Lisa is her problem with me. After a lot of self-reflection and shadow work, I have realized that I have spent too much time caring about what people think of me. I now only care what I think of myself," she wrote on Twitter, proving that she might not be friends with Lisa, but she isn't beating herself up over it anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luckily for Whitney, she's still maintained quite a close relationship with Angie, despite Lisa telling Angie, her friend of over 20 years, that she didn't love the two being friends. This is ultimately where the casino night sabotage stemmed from, leading fans to call out Lisa for her hypocrisy, considering she remains friends with Jen Shah, despite causing pain to Meredith Marks' family.</p><p>Despite Whitney and Lisa not being close, it's certainly making for some great reality TV, and with yet another blow-up set for next week's episode, fans are eager to see where things go this season.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Who Is Whitney's Husband Justin Rose, And How Much Is He Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipoaejobButMSrnKxlp52utXnRnpilpKlitaK8z56lnpxdl7K1w8SepWavmJ7Br7HYZqmoq5Virq%2BwjKWgrJldl66zuM6wZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
