He was a cast member on Saturday Night Live in the 1990s, and he later began an acting career in both film and television. The former Los Angeles home of David Spade is back on the market for $32.5 million, or about 66% more than what the comic actor sold the property for earlier this year—$19.5 million.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED</b><a href=#><b>: </b><b>David Spade Gifts $5K To Burger King Worker As GoFundMe Tops $100,000</b></a></span></p><p>Spade, who this year reprised his voice role of the Invisible Man in <i>Hotel Transylvania: Tranformania</i>, listed the property in January 2022 for just under $20 million and had an offer in hand after less than a week on the market, according to the <a href=#><i>Los Angeles Times</i></a>. Records show the actor-comedian bought the home in 2001 for roughly $4 million.</p><p>Located near the Trousdale Estates section of Beverly Hills, the streamlined midcentury modern home is situated on a roomy three-quarter-acre lot that centers on some of the best views in Los Angeles, according to listing agent Stuart Vetterick with Beverly Hills-based brokerage Hilton & Hyland.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“This is a unique opportunity for someone to purchase an irreplaceable asset. Where else in Trousdale could you find a tennis court property with views of Century City and the ocean together in one,” Vetterick shares.</p><p>Bordered by the celebrity-popular Bird Streets and set at the highest point in Beverly Hills, Trousdale Estates is home to some of Los Angeles’ most notable properties, Spade’s former home included. Noted architects Paul R. Williams, Wallace Neff, A. Quincy Jones and Frank Lloyd Wright designed homes in the neighborhood. Through the years, celebrity residents have included Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Elton John, Ryan Seacrest and Ellen DeGeneres, according to <a href=#><i>Forbes</i></a>,</p><p>The former Spade residence, completed in 1978, was designed by Edward Fickett, a post-war architect who designed more than 50,000 homes across Southern California throughout his career. Updated and modernized through the years, the home for sale features a number of the architect’s hallmarks, including meticulous clean lines and soaring floor-to-ceiling windows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More than 6,400 square feet of polished living space holds an updated chef’s kitchen, a sitting room with a snazzy marble-clad bar, four bedrooms and seven bathrooms. In the main living area, which features a towering indoor “living tree,” the dining room sits elevated above the formal living room.</p><p>Outside, sweeping city-to-ocean views serve as the backdrop for a large, covered patio, a pool deck, fire pit and swimming pool. Next to the pool area is the lighted tennis court, which is oriented from north to south.</p><p>Spade, a former <i>Saturday Night Live</i> cast member, is known for film roles in<i> Tommy Boy, Joe Dirt, Grown Ups</i> and, more recently, <i>The Wrong Missy</i>. Among his television credits are the long-running sitcoms <i>Just Shoot Me!</i> and <i>Rules of Engagement</i>.</p><p>On the real estate side, Spade bought a new property in another part of Los Angeles in late 2021 for $13.85 million, according to reports.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT</b><a href=#><b>:</b></a><a href=#><b>Bob Dylan’s ‘Desolation Row’ Handwritten Lyrics Are Being Sold for $425,000</b></a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a>, <a href=#>Forbes</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmadmaaesW6%2Fz5qbnqtdm7yzucSrZKGnnZp6qrqMpaasZZGjtKa4xKxkoaGkqHq1tMRmpJqqm5rBbrLOq2Rsal1qeq61y6WgqKZf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
