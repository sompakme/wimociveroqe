After all, many people feel that marrying multiple people is wrong, especially when there are kids involved that will grow up to grapple with <a href=#>their own views on polygamy</a>. Amazingly enough, even after TLC weathered that initial storm, it seems like the network now wants to keep some <a href=#>surprising facts about Sister Wives</a> secret.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Strangest Rules The 'Sister Wives' Have To Follow</a></span></p><p>If TLC and the stars of Sister Wives wanted the world to accept the show’s existence and polygamy as a whole, it would be ideal if it seemed like Kody Brown had the same loving relationship with all his wives. As it turns out, however, it seems very clear that Brown has a very different relationship with his four wives and they aren’t all good.</p><h2 id=kody-brown-rsquo-s-relationship-with-janelle-brown>Kody Brown’s Relationship With Janelle Brown</h2><p>When it comes to Kody Brown’s relationship with his second wife Janelle, it seems like their situation has come to be defined by one thing that has changed the world in a lot of ways, COVID-19. After all, as Kody explained to Entertainment Tonight while talking about his relationship with Janelle in February of 2021, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID has put a real strain on our time together</a>”.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Has The 'Sister Wives' Family Been Up To In 2021?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately for Kody Brown and Janelle Brown, despite their struggles, it seems like COVID-19 ultimately brought them closer together. After all, as Janelle explained when she spoke to Entertainment Tonight in 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the pandemic made her reflect on her marriage to Kody</a>.</p><p>"Kody and I have definitely had challenges this year because we've had to spend more time apart than we have ever, probably. So that's definitely something I've had to think about and realize I still like him and want him around, so that was kind of nice. We've been married almost 30 years!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kody-brown-rsquo-s-relationship-with-robyn-brown>Kody Brown’s Relationship With Robyn Brown</h2><p>As of the time of this writing, Robyn Brown is the only person Kody Brown is legally married to. According to Kody, the only reason why Robyn is his only legal wife is so he could adopt her kids from a previous marriage. However, it has been clear for a long time that Kody’s other wives feel that he gives Robyn preferential treatment.</p><p>Given the jealousy that has been directed at Kody Brown’s relationship with Robyn Brown, it likely won’t surprise fans that COVID-19 only added to the drama. The reason for that is simple, Kody spent more time with Robyn during the pandemic than any of his other wives. As Kody told Entertainment Tonight in an aforementioned 2021 interview, there is a practical reason why he was able to be with Robyn so much during the pandemic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything The 'Sister Wives' Have Said About Robyn Brown And Her Relationship With Kody</a></span></p><p>"I see Robyn regularly because there's been no quarantining for Robyn because she's done no traveling." No matter if Robyn’s lack of travel is the only reason why she has gotten to spend more time with Kody over the last few years than his other wives, it certainly seems like they have the closest relationship.</p><h2 id=kody-brown-rsquo-s-relationship-with-christine-brown>Kody Brown’s Relationship With Christine Brown</h2><p>When it comes to Kody Brown’s four famous marriages, the current status of his relationship with Christine Brown is easiest to describe. After all, in late 2021, Christine and Kody announced that after 25 years as a couple, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they were ending their relationship</a>. As Christine explained in a statement, the couple had grown apart but they will remain in each other’s lives as they co-parent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"After more than 25 years together, Kody and I have grown apart and I have made the difficult decision to leave. We will continue to be a strong presence in each other's lives as we parent our beautiful children and support our wonderful family.” In his own statement, Kody professed sadness at the end of his relationship with Christine and respect for her as a person.</p><p>"Christine's decision to leave comes with a great deal of sadness. We enjoyed many years together and I have a large amount of respect and admiration for her. Although we are moving forward on different paths, we will always remain committed parents."</p><h2 id=kody-brown-rsquo-s-relationship-with-meri-brown>Kody Brown’s Relationship With Meri Brown</h2><p>In the year 1990, Meri Brown became Kody Brown’s first wife and for many years, she was the only person he was legally married to. As a result, when Sister Wives first debuted on television, it sometimes seemed like Kody paid more respect to Meri than any of his other wives. Then, in 2015, something happened that changed Meri and Kody’s relationship, seemingly forever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2015, the world learned that Meri Brown had become romantically involved with someone she only knew through social media. At the time, Meri believed that she was communicating with a man named Sam Cooper only for her to later learn that a woman named Jackie Overton had been catfishing her. Once Meri learned that Sam actually was Jackie, she ended things which resulted in the catfisher releasing all kinds of information about their online relationship to the public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meri Brown’s catfishing incident</a> came to light, it has become clear that she no longer has a physical relationship with Kody Brown. While speaking about that situation in 2022, Meri stated “I miss physical intimacy with him”. Despite that, Meri also made it clear that <a href=#>she had no plans to divorce Kody</a>. For his part, Kody clearly doesn’t miss physical intimacy with Meri at all based on his statements. "I'm not going to ever be in a conjugal relationship with her because I'm not going to go through that emotional torture ever again. There's a point where intimacy is just damage."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Sister Wives: 12 Things Kody And Meri Brown Have Come Clean About</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiiqJypYq%2Bzu9anqmaroKTCtLHSZpuinpaav6a602apnqSRqbawutKhoKmrXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
