While fans were excited to have quite a big name attached to the show, considering Rinna's past on-screen work, it became clear that she would be bringing the drama – and messy drama at that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Housewives is all about the over-the-top spectacles, <a href=#><strong>Lisa Rinna</strong></a> managed to take things to a whole new level when it came to her many on-screen RHOBH feuds. Following her attack on Yolanda Hadid, <a href=#>Lisa Rinna gunned for Kim Richards' sobriety</a>, leaving fans with a bad taste in their mouths.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Little-Known Facts About Lisa Rinna And Harry Hamlin's Relationship</a></span></p><p>Well, after six years on the hit show, fans are now calling Rinna out for constantly hitting below the belt, all while deflecting from sharing her own personal life on the reality series. With her allegiance to Erika Jayne this past season being the straw that broke the camel's back, it's evident that fans have had enough of Lisa Rinna, and here's why.</p><h2 id=lisa-rinna-39-s-attack-on-yolanda-hadid><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lisa Rinna's Attack On Yolanda Hadid</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lisa Rinna truly rocked the boat when she accused Yolanda Hadid of faking her Lyme disease diagnosis, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claiming that she has Munchausen syndrome</a>, which is when someone fakes an ailment in order to gain sympathy or attention.</p><p>Rinna claims that Lisa Vanderpump put her up to it, however, after printing out the definition of the syndrome and bringing it to life on national television, it's clear Rinna took the reigns on this takedown all by herself, one that fans really didn't agree with.</p><h2 id=she-came-for-kim-richards-sobriety><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Came For Kim Richards Sobriety</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As if coming for Yolanda's Lyme wasn't bad enough, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Rinna also came after Kim Richards' sobriety</a>. Rinna shared during her time on RHOBH that she believed that a sober Kim was "close to death" and that her sister, Kyle Richards was enabling her drinking habits. Rinna tried to claim she had said no such thing, despite it being on tape.</p><p>While it was evident that Rinna would stop at nothing to come for Kim, she still managed to play victim at the reunion, where fans called her out for what they called "crocodile tears" after Kim revealed vicious text messages sent to her from Lisa. Yikes!</p><h2 id=rinna-plotted-against-lisa-vanderpump><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Rinna Plotted Against Lisa Vanderpump</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Lisa joined RHOBH, it was clear that there would be a battle between the two Lisa's, Rinna, and original cast member, Lisa Vanderpump. During season 9, which marked LVP's final season, Rinna did whatever she could to push the narrative that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LVP had sold a story to Radar Online</a> regarding Dorit Kemsley leaving a dog she adopted from Vanderpump Dogs at a kill shelter.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Lisa Rinna Really Thinks Of Scott Disick</a></span></p><p>Well, it seems as if Rinna isn't letting that narrative die down after a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RHOBH producer shared LVP was behind the story</a>, however, Radar Online editor-in-chief said that wasn't the case. Rinna posted to her Instagram Story recently, calling out Vanderpump for her wicked ways, however, fans were quick to call her out for not having let it go years later.</p><h2 id=lisa-ruined-her-20-year-friendship-with-denise-richards><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Lisa Ruined Her 20 Year Friendship With Denise Richards</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Denise Richards joined the cast of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in season 9, only to leave in season 10. This all happened after Lisa Rinna ran with a story that Denise and former RHOBH star, Brandi Glanville had hooked up.</p><p>Fans were enraged with Rinna, considering she and Denise shared a friendship for over two decades. Lisa wouldn't let the storyline go, despite Denise claiming that the rumors were untrue. This is the point where fans really began to turn on Rinna and considering <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it came at the cost of her friendship</a>, we don't blame viewers for being mad.</p><h2 id=garcelle-claims-lisa-didn-39-t-want-race-to-be-talked-about><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Garcelle Claims Lisa Didn't Want Race To Be Talked About</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the first part of the season 11 RHOBH reunion aired, Garcelle Beauvais shared that she was told that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Rinna didn't want race to be discussed</a> on the series. Lisa was quick to claim that this wasn't the case, however, her reaction was exactly the same as when she denied ever having said Kim Richards was "close to death."</p><p>Fans believe Lisa Rinna did, in fact, make such a statement regarding the topic of race, and Kyle Richards' facial expression when Garcelle dropped this bomb made it even more plausible.</p><h2 id=fans-claim-lisa-rinna-doesn-39-t-39-own-it-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Fans Claim Lisa Rinna Doesn't 'Own It'</span></h2><p>When the rumor regarding Denise Richards came about, Lisa was relentless and wouldn't drop it, so much that it came at the detriment of her relationship with Denise.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Lisa Rinna's Lips Look Like That</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering Lisa Rinna is the queen of "owning it," fans have always felt as if <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she's never truly owned her many wrongdoings</a>, not only to Denise, but to Kim, Yolanda, Brandi, and Lisa Vanderpump, to name a few.</p><h2 id=lisa-rinna-blindly-supports-erika-jayne><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Lisa Rinna Blindly Supports Erika Jayne</span></h2><p>As mentioned, Lisa Rinna wouldn't drop the Denise Richards rumor, gunning for as much inside information that she could get, all while telling Denise to "own it" time and time again. Well, this past season had fans furious with Rinna, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who didn't question Erika Jayne's legal case</a> in the slightest, despite it affecting many victims of plane crashes and fires.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lisa has said that she is allowing the legal process to do its thing before really questioning Jayne, however, fans are pointing out the double standard, claiming she went full force on Denise but has yet to utter a single word to Erika, despite the 'Pretty Mess' singer's situation being far more serious than Denise's silly rumor.</p><h2 id=she-exploited-her-daughter-39-s-eating-disorder><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>She Exploited Her Daughter's Eating Disorder</span></h2><p>Fans also found themselves angry with Lisa Rinna when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she exploited her daughter's eating disorder</a> and later, her daughter's relationship with Scott Disick for the cameras.</p><p>Viewers continue to point out that Rinna never focuses on storylines in her own personal life, rather, she involves herself with stories of those around her. When it came to exploiting her daughters's eating disorder and love life for the show, fans knew exactly who they were dealing with, making it clear it was time for Rinna to go.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>This Is The Truth About Lisa Rinna's Daughters' Disorders</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdl7%2Biws5mnZqmo2Kus7GMqJ2foZOerq242GabqKaVYsSqwMdmo6KrkWK%2FqrrNmmSrnZGheqm71KycsKGmmsBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
