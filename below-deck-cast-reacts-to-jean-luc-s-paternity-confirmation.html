After months of speculation, Below Deck Sailing Yacht star Jean-Luc Cerza-Lanaux confirmed that he fathered Dani Soares‘ baby — but the duo’s fellow cast members weren’t shocked.
“I had no reaction to the news, as I always knew Jean-Luc was the father,” Daisy Kelliher exclusively told Us Weekly on Thursday, January 20. “I knew all along.”
Earlier this week, Jean-Luc, 27, returned to Instagram after a seven-month hiatus to confirm the paternity of Dani’s daughter, Lilly, who was born in May 2021."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He previously claimed that he didn’t know whether he was the father.</p><p>“A new year in 2022 begins with high ambitions and positivity,” he wrote on Wednesday, January 19. “My silence on social media has been intentional and much needed. I used that time to focus on what was important to me and my mental health.”</p><p>The deckhand added that he couldn’t let the year “go any further” without sharing some news about Dani’s baby. “I’m happy and proud to say sweet and beautiful Lilly Rose is my daughter,” he wrote, adding that he took a DNA test to confirm his relation to the little one. “Dani and I have been working and communicating together to the best of our ability; given Dani is a full time mother and worker, and I being gone for extended periods of time not knowing when I will step back on land.”</p><p>The 33-year-old Brazil native, for her part, referenced Jean-Luc’s announcement in a statement to Us, noting that “actions speak louder than words.”</p><p></p><p>The duo <a href=#>began a romance during season 2</a> of Sailing Yacht, which aired in 2021.

I just don’t think it’s anybody’s business right now.”</p><p>During <a href=#>the Sailing Yacht season 2 reunion</a>, which aired in June 2021, Jean-Luc told Dani that <a href=#>he was willing to coparent</a> with her, but he still wanted to take a DNA test.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I understand why she took it poorly because in her mind I might be the only person she’s ever been with,” he explained during the episode. “If that’s the case, I told her, I really do apologize, but for my peace of mind I just wanted to know.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for more of the Below Deck Sailing Yacht cast’s reaction to Jean-Luc’s big reveal:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXsq271mabnpubYrCiv9NmqZ6Zk6nAbsDOZqGemZ5iubav0manmqyVp7uqwNhmmqimlp6%2Frq3ToqanZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
