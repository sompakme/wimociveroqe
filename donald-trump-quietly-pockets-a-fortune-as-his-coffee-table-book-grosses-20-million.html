While Trump is certainly racking up a fortune from the sales of the book, a source&nbsp;also reported&nbsp;that the former president pocketed a multi-million dollar advance.</p><p>Demand for the book is reportedly so high<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> that the publisher can’t keep up.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We still can't keep up with the customers," said Sergio Gor, who founded Winning Team Publish to publish the book. Gor says that he sold all 200,000 copies from the initial run and has requested 300,000 additional copies.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Former First Lady Melania Trump Launches Her Own NFT</a></span></p><p>Gor argues that the appeal of the book stems from Trump's loyal fan base who&nbsp;are “hungry for more of the signature firebrand former President,” and the book is “pure Trump” according to Gor. Instead of offering insight into his decision king as the leader of the free world, the book offers commentary from Trump on how he interpreted each of the scenes in the book.</p><p>"Attempting to listen to crazy Nancy Pelosi in the Oval Office, such natural disagreement," he commented next to one of the photographs.</p><p>Next to another photograph, Trump declared: "Mark Zuckerberg would come to the White House and kiss my ass. His censorship is terrible for America.<a href=#> His 'campaign contributions' even worse."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The book may be sold out, you can still find copies on Amazon and eBay, but expect to pay a premium. A signed copy of&nbsp;Our Journey Together&nbsp;marked as a collectible is selling for $1,749 on Amazon. Copies on eBay are going for $950 all the way up to $1,300.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Trump Agrees To Sell The Marquee Washington Hotel For $375 Million</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSxsLrApZtmrKKqurF50K6gnqycrnqxu8KknK2rXZZ6p7vRraynnV2WwG60yKxknKeWm7KmedOamaWdXZe8sLeMoKmoq6OawG5%2Bj2akoqScnryvew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
