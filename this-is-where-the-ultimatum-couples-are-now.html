The pair ended up getting married immediately after the proposal. The two have since made plans to expand their family and are expecting a child together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Did 'The Ultimatum' Creators Want The Couples To Be Attracted To The Others On The Show?</a></span></p><h2 id=alexis-maloney-and-hunter-parr><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Alexis Maloney And Hunter Parr</span></h2><p>For Alexis and Hunter, The Ultimatum was an avenue to explore Hunter’s reluctance to propose.
