You can [find that again]. And banking on that is a much safer bet than staying and doing and living in that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After confirming his romance with Robinson, Sandoval <a href=#>gushed about her impact on his life.</a></p><p>“This week, my addiction of the week is definitely my friend Victoria that I have been hanging out with. She’s definitely super awesome and she’s one of the sweetest people,” Sandoval shared on the “Billie and the Kid” podcast in February. “Obviously I have known her for a really long time, but we went on our first date last night.”</p><p>He continued: “She is a model, she works a lot and she is very successful. She does well for herself but she is also very humble and really cool. She is just a very sweet, thoughtful person.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuopV2orq%2Bwzq%2BYpWWjncK1v4ydprCmXau2pMDOq6CaZZyasm6%2Bzpugp6ufo3q0vMuiq2aqpaK8s7%2BMsKCtoF2jwKfDjKmgnGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
