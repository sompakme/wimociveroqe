The show also spawned two fairly short-lived spin-off series; 'Raven's Home' and 'Cory In The House'. The latter may have only aired 34 episodes, but it made an impact on the young audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>'Cory In The House' was a spin-off for Kyle Massey, who played Raven's younger brother Cory in the original series. The show saw Cory move to Washington D.C. with his father, who got a role in the President's administration. This meant that the rambunctious and trouble-prone Cory got to play around in The White House... Where he met the children of all the politicians working there, including Sophie Martinez, played by Madison Pettis.</p><p>While Madison stole many of her scenes by playing the totally obnoxious First Daughter, many wonder what happened to her after the show wrapped.</p><p>Here's an inside look at Madison's life after 'Cory In The House'...</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Raven-Symoné Left ‘The View’ For Disney Channel, But What Else Has She Been Up To Lately?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-start-of-madison-s-career-was-in-modeling>The Start Of Madison's Career Was In Modeling</h2><p>Madison Pettis first got noticed when her mother entered herself and Madison into a photoshoot for a parenting magazine in Fort Worth, Texas, not far from where Madison was born and raised. By the age of five, she got her first modeling agent and was booking various gigs. Soon after, she was booking small parts in TV shows like 'Barney&nbsp;& Friends'.</p><p>Then came 'The Game Plan', a 2007 Disney flick that starred Dwayne Johnson AKA "The Rock". In the film, she played Peyton Kelly, The Rock's long-lost 8-year-old daughter in the football film. Because of this role, various casting directors started to take note of the child star and cast her as Corbin Bleu's sister in 'Free Style', 'A Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa', 'Horton Hears A Who!', and 'Seven Pounds' with Will Smith.</p><p>Then came 'Cory in The House', which set Madison up as a bona fide Disney star. Her character even crossed over into <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus' 'Hannah Montana' series</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-disney-status-caused-her-to-be-stuck>The Disney Status Caused Her To Be Stuck</h2><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madison Pettis has said that she's grateful to her time</a> with Disney, as well as the fact that she felt she was treated fairly, there's no doubt that being cast in so many Disney projects caused her career to get stuck. This is the truth with the vast majority of Disney stars who have a very hard time breaking out of the strict confines that The Disney Corporation creates. This includes the fact that she felt as though she was expected to sing. Coming up under Miley, Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato, Madison felt as though she needed to be a triple threat, but she couldn't sing.</p><p>But her roles in Disney projects also made the industry think of her in a certain way.&nbsp;In short, how can anyone take a Disney star seriously as an actor? It happens. But it usually takes some sort of radical change on the part of the star.</p><p>Unfortunately, Madison never made a radical change. Although, she seemed to have had a great time playing a ton of similar roles as she got older. Unlike most child stars, Madison has kept working and completely owned her craft.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, she's appeared in&nbsp;USA Network’s 'The 4400', NBC’S 'Parenthood', 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' and Freeform’s 'The Fosters'.</p><p>Madison even booked two lead roles in 2011, the animated kids series 'Jake and The Never Land Pirates', and YTV's 'Life With Boys'. The latter brought her up to Vancouver and Toronto, Canada to film. Her roles in these kids' show brought her to voice Zuri in 'The Lion Guard', another Disney animated series.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Disney Channel & Nickelodeon Stars Who Are Already Parents</a></span></p><h2 id=madison-s-instagram-presence-and-steamy-new-role-with-rihanna-s-company>Madison's Instagram Presence And Steamy New Role With Rihanna's Company</h2><p>To say that Madison Pettis grew into an absurdly gorgeous young woman would be an understatement. Because of her remarkable beauty, level of fitness, sense of fashion and constant presence at Coachella, Maddison has built a massive Instagram following of millions. It's also earned her endorsement deals with various brands like Fabletics and Revolve.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And then there's Rihanna's company...</p><p>Much liked Sydney Sweeney, Madison Pettis was hand-picked by Rihanna to represent her lingerie company Savage X Fenty as a brand ambassador. The 22-year-old beauty has already been featured in various, sultry, and totally not PG spreads for Rihanna's stunning line. Given how this lingerie brand is set to rival that of Victoria's Secret, we wouldn't be surprised if this elevates Madison's career even more.</p><p>This all happened in the summer of 2020, which has proven to be a big year for Madison.</p><h2 id=some-big-big-things-are-coming>Some Big, Big Things Are Coming...</h2><p>According to Deadline, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madison just signed with CAA</a> (the biggest entertainment agency in the world). This August 2020 move came after it was announced that Madison would be starring in the 'American Pie' reboot 'Girls' Rules'... something that we're sure President Martinez wouldn't approve of. Additionally, the move was made because of Madison's role as Natasha 'Tosh' Bennett in 'Five Points', Facebook Watch's very first completely scripted series that was produced by Indigenous Media and Simpson Street, Kerry Washington's production company. The show ran for two seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Madison seemingly fell into the world of kids' shows after 'Cory In The House', but it appears as though her presence is growing and the coming years will be huge for her.</p><p>We wish her tons of luck!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Photos Of Raven-Symoné Since ‘That’s So Raven’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZKGZoKWyr7HDZquoZZOkv7p5yKdkraCVYrWwwdKeZKyskad6rq3Doqqopl2lsrXAyKxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
