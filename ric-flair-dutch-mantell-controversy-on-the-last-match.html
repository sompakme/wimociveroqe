The event was nominated several times in the Wrestling Observer annual awards for the worst wrestling match of 2022. 
Flair responded to the award announcements by revealing that he made $300,000 for the show and told his critics to “go f**k yourselves.” "><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I think he passed out a time or two in there. He doesn’t even remember it. Ric Flair now is trying to leave a legacy and he should have left it alone, or changed a lot of things in that match, because his legacy now is tarnished. I don’t know. Ric Flair is full of s**t and always has been.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>However, this response did not sit well with Mantell, who has been critical of Flair in the past.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mantell’s criticism of Flair’s last match</h2><p>Mantell spoke on his podcast, Story Time with Dutch Mantell, about Flair’s performance in his comeback match.&nbsp;</p><p>He claimed that people had written to him expressing concern that Flair was going to die in the ring.&nbsp;Mantell also stated that Flair had passed out during the match and didn’t even remember it.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Mantell, Flair’s attempt to leave a legacy with his last match event has backfired and tarnished his own legacy.&nbsp;He further accused Flair of being <strong>“full of s**t and always has been.”</strong></p><p>Flair fired back at Mantell with a scathing tweet in which he accused Dutch of not having a legacy in pro wrestling.&nbsp;</p><p>Mantell responded on Sportskeeda Wrestling’s Smack Talk, taking multiple shots at Flair and even mocking his iconic “Woo” catchphrase.&nbsp;</p><p>He also claimed that 90% of the fans agreed with his statement about Flair’s Last Match.</p><p>As per Mantell, Flair’s response to his criticism was disrespectful because he did not tag him in the tweet.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Flair and Mantell’s wrestling history</h2><p>This is not the first time that Mantell has criticized Flair. He previously accused Flair of lying about being in Puerto Rico when Bruiser Brody was killed in 1988.</p><p>Flair and Mantell have a history that dates back to their time working together in the wrestling industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Their current feud stems from Mantell’s comments about Flair’s Last Match event, which Flair took offense to.</p><p>The beef between Flair and Mantell shows no signs of slowing down, with both men taking turns at each other on <a href=#>social media</a> and in interviews. It remains to be seen if they will reconcile or if their feud will continue to escalate.&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, it is clear that Mantell’s criticism of Flair’s Last Match has struck a nerve, and Flair’s response has not done much to win him any supporters.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2ByJxkn6SRnr9usNStmqFlnZa7tbHLpWScp56pv7DCxKuqsmWfo3q1tMRmo5qrpGK6osDCoWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
