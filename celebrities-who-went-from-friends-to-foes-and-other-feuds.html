With controversial statements, gnarly situations, and shocking moves, here are some of the most controversial celebrity friend to foes and feud stories that had fans shook.</p><h2 id=the-whole-kanye-west-taylor-swift-saga><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Whole Kanye West Taylor Swift Saga</span></h2><p>Fans could probably recall one of the biggest and most brutal scandals in the world of music which took place at the 2009 VMAs. Kanye West interrupted Taylor Swift's acceptance speech for Video of The Year. The rapper apologized and things seemed to quiet down as there was even talk they might collab.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But all that ended when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye took jabs at Taylor in his song "Famous"</a> with inappropriate lyrics that Taylor came out to say that she never approved. Kim Kardashian even got involved, and the whole internet went aflame for a while. Probably all fans know that Swift's album Reputation discussed her feelings and reflections regarding the feud and how people saw her, but <a href=#>the whole feud timeline goes on for numerous years with so many details</a>. The singer was definitely a trooper to have gone through that and still come out on top.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="What Did Taylor Swift Say After Being Interrupted By Kanye West?">What Did Taylor Swift Say After Being Interrupted By Kanye West?</a></span></p><h2 id=paris-hilton-and-nicole-richie-had-their-rough-patch><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie Had Their Rough Patch</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie were the poster besties of the 2000s</a>. Their shared reality show The Simple Life captured their extra friendship back in 2003 till 2005 when they seemingly broke off their friendship all of a sudden. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Hilton went on the record with a statement saying</a>, "It’s no big secret that Nicole and I are no longer friends. Nicole knows what she did, and that’s all I’m ever going to say about it.” However, the beef was squashed when they resumed their show and seemed to be back on great footing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Who’s Been More Successful After ‘The Simple Life’: Nicole Richie Or Paris Hilton?">Who’s Been More Successful After ‘The Simple Life’: Nicole Richie Or Paris Hilton?</a></span></p><h2 id=cardi-b-and-nicki-minaj-got-physical><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Cardi B And Nicki Minaj Got Physical</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seemed like all was quiet in the rap world up until Nicki Minaj and Cardi B started exchanging disses hidden quaintly in their songs. The jabs kept going back and forth for a while, but things heated up beyond fans' expectations in 2018 at the New York Fashion Week Harper's Bazaar Party. Reportedly, Minaj insulted Cardi B as a mom and then shoes and punches went flying in a physical altercation. Both rappers chose the path of peace later on and posted on their instagram stories messages about being positive and moving forward.</p><h2 id=nicki-minaj-called-out-miley-cyrus><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Nicki Minaj Called Out Miley Cyrus</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before the 2015 VMAs aired, hosted by Cyrus herself, Nicki Minaj spoke out against the music industry as discriminative because her video for "Anaconda" wasn't nominated, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley clapped back criticising her for thinking that it was Taylor Swift who snubbed her</a>. That's what led to the VMA confrontation which later seemingly fizzled out to a truce. That was only up until Miley released a diss track called "Cattitutude" calling out Nicki and saying, "I love you Nicki, but I listen to Cardi." With the Cardi vs Nicki feud being notorious, <a href=#>it's safe to say that the truce is certainly off for the two divas</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Fans Think Miley Cyrus Wants To Dethrone Nicki Minaj With Her New Release Tease">Fans Think Miley Cyrus Wants To Dethrone Nicki Minaj With Her New Release Tease</a></span></p><h2 id=mariah-carey-vs-jennifer-lopez-went-to-the-court-of-public-opinion><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mariah Carey Vs Jennifer Lopez Went To The Court Of Public Opinion</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in the 2000s both pop queens enjoyed massive success and exposure, but when a reporter asked Mariah Carey about Jennifer Lopez, the singer replied, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"I don't know her."</a> Needless to say, fans took offense to what Carey said, but she clarified her statement on Watch What Happens Live saying, "That was so long ago, I can't believe people still make such a big deal out of it. Apparently, I am forgetful, It wasn't like I don't know who she is—of course I do. That's not the question." Fans still question whether or not she really meant not knowing JLo personally or if she was taking a jab at her. Fans do know however that the two divas are not on talking terms today.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-and-katy-perry-had-bad-blood><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Taylor Swift And Katy Perry Had Bad Blood</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While they replied to tweets and always seemed cheerful around each other during awards shows, fans always sensed that something was off about Katy Perry and Taylor Swift's relationship. With most rumors saying that Taylor's song "Bad Blood" was about Katy Perry, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift explained where her lyrics are coming from saying</a>, "For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not. She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think ‘Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?'”</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-is-paris-hilton-39-s-ex-bff><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kim Kardashian Is Paris Hilton's Ex BFF</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 2000s saw the two friends blossom and become iconic in social circles as Kim was just starting to become the monolith she is today. However, after Kim left her position as Hilton's personal assistant on not the best of terms, the two friends drifted completely apart. Luckily for the world of entertainment, the two reunited again in many short format skits ensuring fans that there will always be good blood between them.</p><h2 id=drake-and-meek-mill-39-s-feud-was-a-blessing-in-disguise><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Drake and Meek Mill's Feud Was A Blessing In Disguise</span></h2><p>The song "Going Bad" marked the end of a feud between Meek Mill and Drake that started in 2015 with a tweet by Mill saying, "Stop comparing me to Drake too.... He don't write his own raps! That's why he ain't tweet my album because we found out!" A series of tweets, diss tracks, and memes exploded on the internet following that till the two rapper squashed their beef and gave the world a hit banger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmaeop6yr7DSZquoZZaksrR5xZ6snatdqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBbrfAp7CeZaCWv6q%2FjKGgpayfo3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
