It’s quite a drive to Dodger Stadium — roughly 30 miles — but the community makes up for the distance with a bucolic lifestyle where many celebrities have bought properties in search of privacy.</p><p>The property makes the most of its space with an 11,000-square-foot mansion, guest apartment and guesthouse surrounded by amenities such as a swimming pool, spa, tennis court and putting green, per <a href=#><i>Los Angeles Times.</i></a></p><p>Dramatic in style, the main home boasts French-inspired spaces adorned with ornate fireplaces, custom wallpapers and floors of wood and stone. Highlights include a movie theater, marble bar, wine cellar, library and game room.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms complete the main house, including a primary suite with a balcony overlooking the landscaped grounds.</p><p>The sale is a family affair. Scully’s daughter, Cat Scully, holds the listing with Mimi Bladow. Both agents are with Compass.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7c12a2f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x1928+0+0/resize/1440x723!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F24%2Fd0%2F5185530f4ee9b8dbd35feea4ad7c%2Fimage-15.jpg"><p>“Having the honor of listing our family home is bittersweet,” Scully said. “Our home was full of so many beautiful memories, love and laughter, but as my dad used to say, there is a season and a time for everything in life.”</p><p>At $15 million, it’s the sixth-priciest property currently on the market in Hidden Hills. Madonna is asking $26 million for a home she bought from The Weeknd, and NBA star Ben Simmons is shopping around his modern farmhouse for $21.5 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scully spent 67 seasons with the Dodgers before retiring in 2016 after a decorated career that saw him elected into the Radio Hall of Fame and the California Sports Hall of Fame. For his distinct narrative style, he is considered one of the best, if not the best, baseball broadcaster of all-time.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>Aleali May Released First Mayde Worldwide Collection Made In L.A</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmavoZ5iwKTBy6WwrGWYnrGlsc1mn6KknKh6rq3NrKCopl2htrTA0madqKpdZoJuucilo6KnnmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
