I hope it’s true … I share this to keep it 💯, and hoping that the knowledge of my experience might be useful to someone else out there experiencing the grip of heartbreak who is poised to try and escape from the pain and miss out on the wisdom that comes from it. #Breakup.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lupita-Nyong-o-Opens-Up-About-How-Friendship-Is-Helping-Her-Through-Heartbreak-inline.jpg><p>She later thanked fans for showing her support as she heads into the next chapter. “Thank you for all the kindness I have received from sharing my heartbreak news,” she gushed in a since-expired Instagram Story. “The words of encouragement mean more to me than I anticipated. They are a balm. … And it feels comforting to have a little corner online for the romantically heartbroken to gather.”</p><p>In the last month, Nyong’o <a href=#>has been spotted out and about multiple times</a> as she recovers from the emotional turmoil. One day before announcing her breakup, she was spotted spending time at a <a href=#><strong>Janelle Monáe</strong></a> concert with <a href=#><strong>Joshua Jackson</strong></a>. The <a href=#>Dawson’s Creek </a>alum, 45, recently called it quits with estranged wife<a href=#><strong> Jodie Turner-Smith</strong></a>, whom he wed in 2019.</p><p>Turner-Smith, 37, filed for divorce in October, <a href=#>citing “irreconcilable differences”</a> as the reason for the split. She is also seeking joint custody of their 3-year-old daughter.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While the pair have yet to publicly address their breakup, a source exclusively told<i>&nbsp;</i>Us Weekly last month that Jackson <a href=#>was “caught off guard”</a> when the Queen & Slim star filed the divorce paperwork.</p><p>“They had their issues, as many couples do — especially two busy actors who are also juggling a child. Joshua obviously didn’t realize it was this bad, that Jodie was this unhappy,” the insider explained. “Their friends are baffled and trying to understand how this came about.”</p><p>Meanwhile, another source told Us that Turner-Smith decided to end the relationship because “<a href=#>she refused to settle for something</a> that didn’t feel right.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalraCewaJ5zbKmp5%2BfYryxsc2sZK6oXZavsMHTZq6hmaSoeqmxy6mgp59dnbKzedOhqaitl516qbHAq6ubqpWWuHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
