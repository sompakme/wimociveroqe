People kept coming up to me [and saying,] ‘Congratulations.’ I’m like, ‘Sssh, can y’all stop? I got a liquor sponsorship on the line.

We spend all this time together, and he really is my closest friend.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Shortly after sharing her pregnancy news, Palmer gushed over the fitness instructor. “Thank you to my other half @dvulton for giving me the things that only true unity can bring,” she wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> on December 5. “Love is all we have isn’t it, you do nothing in this world alone and trust me, I am not alone!”</p><p>Before Jackson, Palmer was linked to musician <strong>Styn</strong>, <strong>Rodney King</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Quincy Brown</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>YG</strong>.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaknZuaerGty6acq2WXnsOmv4yboKusmGLEprjCqKSeq11mwLV5wqGgpZxdrLa1tIydmKuhpah6q63CpKqopl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
