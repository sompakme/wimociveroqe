Therefore, it should not come as a surprise to learn that he fled from LA, to purchase a townhouse in Manhattan. David wanted the move to be private but once construction started taking place, the locals were none too pleased.Let's take a look at what went down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-schwimmer-left-his-la-mansion-back-in-2011>David Schwimmer Left His LA Mansion Back In 2011</h2><p>Back in 2011, David Schwimmer decided to leave the LA life, putting his stunning mansion up for sale. <a href=#>The price tag wasn't a cheap one</a>, valued at $10.7 million. The home wasn't short on space, featuring over 11,000 square feet, along with nine bedrooms and 6 bathrooms. Dirt listed some of the other expensive details relating to the home.</p><p>"The interior spaces include formal living and dining rooms, a wood paneled library, stone-walled den, and a newly-installed state-of-the-art screening room. While the house was largely remodeled when Mister Schwimmer acquired it he did do over the back yard, install new heating and air conditioning systems and restored the windows, doors and hardwood floors."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Real Harry's House: The Homes Harry Styles Has Bought Over The Years</a></span></p><p>Following the sale, David Schwimmer had other plans in mind, wanting to leave LA completely. He would purchase a pad in Chicago and along with that, he had his eyes on a townhouse over in Manhattan. This must've thrilled the neighbors, who doesn't want to live next to Ross! However, once it was established that David bought the home with construction plans in mind, the mood around the block quickly soured.</p><h2 id=david-schwimmer-s-neighbors-were-not-happy-with-his-construction-plans>David Schwimmer's Neighbors Were Not Happy With His Construction Plans</h2><p>He made the purchase in 2010, setting his sights on a townhouse in New York's East village. At the time, Schwimmer purchased the property for $4.1 million. The house was a landmark of the area, standing since 1852. That's when things got tricky, as David planned to tear down the townhouse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Mirror, <a href=#>this did not sit well with others that lived in the area</a>. "All the new people are yuppie transients. If I see David Schwimmer on the street, I’ll be sure to give him my two cents!' said Charlett Hobart, a retired independent contractor who has lived on the block for the past 37 years told the New York Post. People who have been living here a long time don’t like new people coming in' and tearing down old buildings, she explained."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Amber Heard Has $1 Million Getaway Home In The Desert Ready For Her Post-Trial Escape</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The plan for Schwimmer was to replace the five-story building with a six-story mansion with an elevator and roof terrace. In terms of size before the construction, the townhouse was 7,750 square feet to 9,000 square feet - smaller than his LA home. It seems like David ultimately wanted a bigger space, even if it angered the others.</p><h2 id=privacy-is-of-the-utmost-importance-for-david-schwimmer>Privacy Is Of The Utmost Importance For David Schwimmer</h2><p>Despite his massive fame, privacy has always been the biggest factor for David Schwimmer and his family. The star revealed in past interviews <a href=#>that coping with fame wasn't always easy.</a></p><p>"It was pretty jarring," Schwimmer said. "It messed with my relationship to other people in a way that took years, I think, for me to adjust to and become comfortable with."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The effect of celebrity was the absolute opposite: It made me want to hide under a baseball cap and not be seen," he said. "I realized after a while that I was no longer watching people. I was trying to hide."</p><p>Schwimmer would further reveal that a major reason for this, was also given the fact that he played the same role for years. This made fans assume they already knew him. "There's less of a barrier with, say, a big movie star," Schwimmer said. "You see them in this other kind of a space with a lot of other people on a big screen, and you see that their role changes in every movie, for the most part. They're very different people in very different situations—whereas in our show I'm the same guy for 10 years. You can rely on me to be a certain way, and you know me—or you think you know me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully, Schwimmer is better with the attention these days, though he still wants to keep things quiet, unless he has construction plans to take care of...</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Fans Think 'Friends' Might Have Ruined David Schwimmer's Career</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dm7%2Bqsc2dqmarpJa%2FbrDAr6CdZaOYtbi1zKacq6tdqby4useorKydXaXCs6%2FHmqqeZZmjeq6tzaGYrayRo3qiusaeqZ6cXZa5rXnHoqpmppWetKmuzq6prGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
