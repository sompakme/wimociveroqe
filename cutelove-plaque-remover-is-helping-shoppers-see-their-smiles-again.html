After checking out several close-ups of results, we’ve become full believers in the power of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this device</a>. It works similar to the plaque removal tools you typically find at dentist’s office and helps to chisel away buildup which can’t be eliminated by standard brushing or water flossing.</p><p>What’s particularly cool about <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this tool</a> is that it automatically stops vibrating when it doesn’t sense a hard surface, so if you’re working on your teeth and the pick touches your gums, it will shut off immediately.
