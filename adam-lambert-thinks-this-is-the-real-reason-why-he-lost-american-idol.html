Although he didn’t believe he had what it takes to win the competition. "I didn’t think I was the right kind of performer to … I didn’t think I would work on the show," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lambert told Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><p>"I thought, 'Oh, I’m not the type that they look for.'” Plus, he was nervous about not making the cut because he had to quit his job to be able to compete in the show. Despite this, he quickly became the fans’ and the judges’ favorite contestant. That’s why everyone was so shocked when the winner of the eighth season of American Idol was announced.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Adam Lambert Was Dropped From Good Morning America After His Controversial Performance The Night Before</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2009, the results of the season finale of American Idol’s eighth season shocked fans. Despite being the fans’ and the judge’s favorite, Lambert was the second place, while competition to Arkansas-native <a href=# rel=nofollow>singer-songwriter Kris Allen won the competition</a>.</p><h2 id=did-adam-lambert-lose-american-idol-for-breaking-one-of-the-show-rsquo-s-most-important-rules>Did Adam Lambert Lose American Idol For Breaking One Of The Show’s Most Important Rules?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar50174126.jpg><p>Like any other competition, American Idol has a long list of rules contestants have to adhere to in order to appear in the show. While some of these rules make sense, others are just plain weird, like the <a href=# rel=nofollow>rule that bans American Idol contestants from running for office</a> after competing on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To compete in American Idol, contestants must be 15 to 29 years old, be legal residents, and not have any pending contracts or record deals. All contestants also have to disclose their criminal records to the show’s producers beforehand. These rules are not taken lightly. For instance, season 11th finalist, Jermaine Jones, was removed from the competition because he had pending criminal charges American Idol producers were not made aware of.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Adam Lambert Fired His Former Record Label When They Asked Him To Do A Covers Album He Had No Interest In</a></span></p><p>Shortly after he left American Idol, it was revealed that Adam Lambert had signed to a record before competing in the show. A year before his audition, the singer had recorded an album titled Beg For Mercy with Colwel Platinum Entertainment.</p><p>Although this seemed like a violation of one of the show’s biggest rules, he was allowed to compete in the eighth season of American Idol.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, Lambert didn’t lose to Kris Allen because of his previous recording deal. But the singer was sued for breaking his contract with Colwel Platinum Entertainment in 2012.</p><h2 id=adam-lambert-believes-that-he-lost-american-idol-because-of-his-sexuality>Adam Lambert Believes That He Lost American Idol Because Of His Sexuality</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar48474006.jpg><p>Shortly after the finale season's eighth finale of American Idol was broadcasted, the Huffington Post published an article claiming that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">homophobia was the reason why Kris Allen had won over Adam Lambert</a>.</p><p>The article explained that the audience was more likely to support a singer with a Christian background like Allen rather than an openly gay man like Lambert. Although the singer didn’t comment on this article in 2009, some of his most recent comments prove that he agrees with this take.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a recent interview with Variety to promote his latest project, the Sofia Coppola-produced drama Fairyland, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lambert was asked if he thinks homophobia is the reason why he didn’t win American Idol</a>.</p><p>To this, he responded: “Probably. But it was 10 years ago.” Then he went on to explain how this new project related to his experiences as an openly gay man in entertainment. “The thing about our film is that even though it takes place in the 1970s, there are so many ideas in it that are current. LGBTQ people are under attack again by the conservative part of our country.”</p><p>Despite not winning American Idol, Lambert’s career skyrocketed and now is stronger than ever. Since 2009, the singer has released five studio albums. His debut album, For Your Entertainment, became number three on the U.S. Billboard 200 and earned him a Grammy nomination for "Best Male Pop Vocal Performance." He has also <a href=# rel=nofollow>collaborated with the rock band Queen</a> for numerous tours and has ventured into acting on several occasions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnZmdYrmiucGeqa1lpJ22r7fSZquhoaNitrR506GcZqqVlsCwuoywn7JlmJp6rbvSrWSapZWntqStzWagnaecZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
