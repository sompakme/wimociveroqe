The brothers took the world of boxing by storm in 2020 when<a href=#> Jake Paul</a> agreed to fight his fellow Youtube star AnEsonGib and former NBA Player, Nate Robinson. Then <a href=#>Logan Paul</a> stepped in the ring for an exhibition boxing match with the unbeaten boxing champion, Floyd Mayweather. With their celebrity on Youtube, they gave their fans something to look forward to by becoming sensationalized boxers. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, Jake and Logan Paul made a combined purse of $63 million in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Problem Child entered 2021 on a mission and lined up a tougher breed of opponents, starting with MMA fighter Ben Askren, who Paul beat in dominating style. Then, he proved to the world that his victory in August over <a href=#>UFC</a> champion, Tyron Woodley, was no fluke by beating him for the second time in December after his original opponent, Tommy Fury, pulled out due to a rib injury. This time, he shut the mouths of his naysayers by <a href=#>laying Woodley flat</a> on the canvas with a knockout punch. His fifth fight bought his victory streak to 5-0. And just in 2021, his three highly anticipated fights placed him at No. 2 on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a> list of highest-paid Youtube stars of 2021, earning $45 million from those three fights alone. Logan Paul also shared in the limelight but grossed only $18 million from his fight with Mayweather in June 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the build-up in his first fight against Tyron Woodley in August, Jake Paul compared his greatness to the late Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, and <a href=#>Floyd Mayweather</a>. And while that statement may seem a bit arrogant and even premature, considering he only has five fights under his belt, some may argue that when it comes to his financial prowess, he is allowed those bragging rights.</p><p>Placed next to a real professional boxing athlete like <a href=#>Canelo Alvarez</a> who is seasoned with 67 fights and 49 by way of knockout, his earning for 2021 was well over $40 million. The P4P King earned $30 million for his win against the Turkish boxer, Yildirim; $35 million against Billy Joe Saunders last May, and $40 million against Caleb Plant in November, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">totaling over $100 million</a>. Tyson Fury also ended the years on a good note with a total of $40 million for 2021 after his signature KO against Deontay Wilder.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Logan Paul also raked in a sizeable grab in 2021, earning $18 million from his exhibition fight against Floyd "Money" Mayweather. The Youtubers-turned-boxers don't seem to be showing any signs of backing down in the boxing arena. Moving forward, it is believed that negotiations are being made for fights with veterans like <a href=#>Conor McGregor</a>, who is the reigning highest-paid UFC fighter to date.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Jake Paul Gets A $500k Championship Belt Along With A Rolex As An Early Christmas Gift</a></strong></p><p><strong>NEXT:<a href=#> Logan Paul Says Floyd Mayweather Hasn't 'Coughed Up' The Millions That He's Owed&nbsp;</a></strong></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Essentially Sports</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMqZiupF2aurG10Z5ko5mbmnqiusNmo6ifkaN6sa3UpWSrnaCkv7Wxw6WwZqWRmbJugpJmpKKknJ68r3nIp2RraGJmeqK4zqecaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
