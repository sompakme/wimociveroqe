The obsession with smooth and tightened skin has led to an industry of creams, lotions, and oils designed to help lessen the appearance of sagging skin and cellulite. But it turns out that these products don't always live up to their promises. Oftentimes they can be very expensive and often contain strange and harmful ingredients.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="Fans Are Dying To Know Jessica Simpson's Exercise Routine After 100 Pound Weight Loss">Fans Are Dying To Know Jessica Simpson's Exercise Routine After 100 Pound Weight Loss</a></span>Now there's a new option, though, for enhancing the look and feel of your skin. Bum Bum (pronounced boom, boom) Cream by Sol De Janeiro. This cream is specifically designed for use on your behind and other areas where you want things tightened up. Bum Bum cream uses only natural ingredients like guaraná, brazil nut, coconut butter, and Guayusa (a caffeinated tea leaf from the Amazon) in order to give you the appearance of firmer skin without any nasty chemicals. It also smells like a dream. The pistachio, salted caramel, and vanilla scent is so uplifting; it's like you are on the beach somewhere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>​​​​​​​Please note: the following are affiliate links in which we may earn commissions on.</strong></p><h2 id=the-truth-about-cellulite-cream><strong>The Truth About Cellulite Cream</strong></h2><p>Firming creams and serums are a great way to supplement any workout plan, but they're not a permanent solution.<a href=#> Manhattan board-certified dermatologist Dr. Rebecca Baxt says</a> it's not a permanent solution. Technically, any cream or serum is a temporary fix "If the skin is dry and lifeless, a good moisturizer can help firm it up."</p><p>But if you want to see the best results, Dr. Baxt recommends finding a moisturizer that contains Retinol-A. Retinol-A is thought to help remodel collagen just underneath the surface of the skin. There are no lotions that can go deep enough to alter muscle tone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="Best Spanx Swimear, Athletic Wear, And Everything In Between To Fit All Body Shapes">Best Spanx Swimear, Athletic Wear, And Everything In Between To Fit All Body Shapes</a></span>Caffeine is often touted as the main ingredient in many anti-aging products, but it's important to look for water on the label. If your skin is dry, it needs moisture. Firming' is a marketing term, but your skin will look plumper, and more 'firm' when it's moist, not dry. Most of the products on the market should be able to provide a good level of moisturizer.</p><p>If someone is looking for more than what a lotion can actually provide, a body-contouring/toning therapy at a medical spa is ideal. In comparison to your bottle of firming creams and serums, ultrasound and radiofrequency equipment all help to tighten and tone the skin and provide faster, longer-lasting results.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-truth-about-bum-bum-cream><strong>The Truth About Bum Bum Cream</strong></h2><p>If you're familiar with the latest beauty products, you've probably heard of Bum Bum Cream. But do you know what makes it so great? Bum Bum Cream is rich in Guaraná, a native Amazonian plant whose fruit contains one of the most potent forms of caffeine on the planet. In Brazil, they believe you're as beautiful as you feel. Beauty isn't a universal standard to reach, but an attitude to take. It's about radiating the confidence that comes from playing up your best assets.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="Has SKIMS Been As Successful As Kim Kardashian Hoped (And What Is The Company Worth Today)?">Has SKIMS Been As Successful As Kim Kardashian Hoped (And What Is The Company Worth Today)?</a></span>Sol de Janeiro means Sun of January.
