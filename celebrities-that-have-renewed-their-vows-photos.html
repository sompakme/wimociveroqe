Jenny McCarthy and Donnie Wahlberg have made a tradition out of renewing their vows every year after initially tying the knot in August 2014."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Whether they’re celebrating a milestone anniversary, like <a href=#><strong>Alec </strong></a>and <a href=#><strong>Hilaria Baldwin</strong></a>, or recommitting to one another following a rough patch, like <a href=#><strong>Sharon</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ozzy Osbourne</strong></a> or <a href=#><strong>Beyoncé</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Jay-Z</strong></a>, plenty of stars have taken a second plunge with their spouses.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Jenny McCarthy</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Donnie Wahlberg</strong></a> have made a tradition out of <a href=#>renewing their vows every year</a> after initially tying the knot in August 2014.</p><p>“We always do it!” the Masked Singer star exclusively told Us Weekly in September 2019. “And it’s so nice to take that moment when you’re so busy to remember those words that you say to each other and the vows and the promises. Not that we need it, but it’s nice to do. … Every day I wake up and go, ‘I married my Prince Charming.’”</p><p>McCarthy noted upon her five-year anniversary with Wahlberg that the renewal of their vows never got old. “Every renewal feels like this. We can’t believe it’s been five years because it feels like it’s been a lifetime,” she gushed. “But also feels like it’s been two weeks. It’s weird because we have that new love feeling.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Heidi Klum</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Seal</strong></a> also <a href=#>renewed their vows annually</a> after marrying in May 2005. However, they still split in January 2012 and finalized their divorce in October 2014.</p><p>“I think I got married eight times to Seal,” the supermodel told the Sunday Times in July 2021. “I thought it would be kind of, like, fun.”</p><p>She added: “I thought it would be a fest of love. But you know, that doesn’t work either. I tried, you can’t say I didn’t try!”</p><p>Klum confessed that she lost faith in the ceremonies after a while as she felt “this is really not working,” although she “tried” to stay the course.</p><p>Seal, meanwhile, was not a fan of the vow renewals. “That was my ex-wife’s idea, to be honest,” he said on Radio Andy in November 2015. “It kind of <a href=#>turned into a little bit of a circus</a>, which I wasn’t terribly fond of because, by default, I’m quite a private person.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When host <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> mentioned how highly publicized the ceremonies were, the singer shared, “That’s the thing I disliked most about it.”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see which stars said “I do” to their significant others more than once!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKa4xJupoqyZmsBuwMeaq2agkauybr7Ep5ywnZRiwamxyKtkr6enqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
