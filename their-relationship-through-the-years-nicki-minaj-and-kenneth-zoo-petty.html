In December 2018, the rapper caused a stir by publicly announcing her relationship with convicted sex offender Kenneth “Zoo” Petty.</p><p>Since their October 2019 wedding, none of them has been fazed by the criticism of their fast courtship. Minaj has defended Petty on Instagram, where she has also been sharing PDA-filled photographs and videos of the couple.</p><p>The Queens native has stated repeatedly that she wants to find a long-term partner and create a family. She has been romantically linked to rappers Safaree Samuels, Meek Mill, and Nas.</p><p>“If I’m done with my fifth album and I don’t have a child by then, no matter how much money I had, I would be unhappy, as a woman,” she told Complex in December 2014. I have delayed getting married because I don’t want outsiders meddling in my personal life.</p><p>Although I’d prefer to avoid signing any legal documents until after I’ve had my baby, you may rest assured that I’ll be married. I need to follow that sequence precisely. My mother instilled that belief in me from an early age, and I’ve held onto it ever since. When I release my fifth album, I will have tied the knot and am expecting at least my first child and probably my second. And be in possession of $500 million.”</p><p>However, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Minaj</a> has stated categorically that she has never depended on a man. There was an epiphany the moment I realized I could go on with my life—without a boyfriend—and still eat, sleep, walk, and converse.</p><p>The fact that, despite my youth, I am financially independent of men. Telling Elle in July of 2018, “I don’t need a man for the job,” she proved that statement to be true. As the saying goes, “I’ve never had to f-k for beats. To get a record contract, I’ve never had to f-ck anyone. That sort of stress is not something I have to deal with. When I get up, I choose, and when I go to the store, I choose.</p><h2>We’re Now in December 2018!</h2><p>Minaj has ignored the online backlash she’s received for dating Petty, many of whom have pointed out the rapper’s criminal history, including his conviction for attempted rape in 1995 and his guilty plea for manslaughter in 2006.</p><p>(He’s been locked up for a while now.) According to the police report, the rape victim was 16 years old, and the offender was 15 years old. She captioned a racy selfie of herself and Petty in bed with the phrase, “But go awf, Internet,” which she posted to Instagram in December 2018. This is not your life, and you have no right to dictate how I live mine. You people are so inept that you can’t even manage your own affairs. “Thanks a lot, bud.”</p><h2>This Coming October 2019</h2><p>In October of 2019, Minaj announced on Instagram that she and Petty had tied the knot. She titled a clip of “Mr.” and “Mrs.” baseball caps and coffee mugs “Onika Tanya Maraj-Petty 10•21•19.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Cj2zij7LANI/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>When Moses Passed Away, What Age Was He?</a></p><h2>As of The Month of February 2020</h2><p>On Queen Radio in February 2020, Minaj raved over Petty, saying, “Whenever I’m down, I can have one discussion with my spouse and it will get me back where I need to be mental.” He has been an extremely positive influence on my life. Having known him since I was 17, I am able to be completely open and honest about who I am with him in a way that I was not able to do with anyone else.</p><h2>September 2021</h2><p>During a Zoom Hearing with The Los Angeles Federal Court in 2019, Petty Pled Guilty to Failing to Register as A Sex Offender After He Moved to California in 2019. in 1995, Minaj’s Husband Was Convicted of Attempted Rape in New York and Sentenced to Almost 4.5 Years in Jail. the Terms of His Conviction Require Him to Report as A Sex Offender Wherever He Goes.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/gettyimages-1097932874-d252525059d04c98991cacba3957e532.jpg alt="who is nicki minaj dating" width=1500 height=1500 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Government Claims that Petty May Get up To Ten Years in Federal Prison, Be on Probation for The Rest of His Life, and Have to Pay a Fine of $250,000 or Twice the Gross Loss He Caused, Whichever Is Greater.
