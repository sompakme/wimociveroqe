And I f–king look good! You have a beautiful wife and you’re f–king obsessed with the stupid f–king strip club.”</p><p>In a confessional interview, Jovi admits that he knew his wife would be upset about the strip club, but he didn’t think it would escalate as far as it did. “I was just trying to show the guys a fun night, and that’s it,” he tells the cameras. “And knowing that she wouldn’t be overly thrilled with the fact that I was going to a strip club was part of the reason that I didn’t want to tell her. But now I feel like she’s just taking her insecurities out on me and I think she’s making it out to be more than what it needs to be.”</p><p>Before the duo can resolve the tension, however, Jovi shuts down the conversation because he has a headache. After telling Yara to “shut up, please,” he storms out, claiming that “it’s too early” for this discussion. “This is disgusting,” Yara says.</p><p>90 Day Fiancé: The Last Resort debuted in August and follows five couples as they make final attempts to salvage their relationships.
