Starving patrons can chow down on salami, rosemary ham, provolone, and sun-dried tomatoes spread out on a toasted focaccia bun. The gargantuan delight comes with marinara dipping sauce and an arugula salad. If you just want a solo version, it'll run you $14.50. They also offer a “shrunken, child-size” version called “Teeny Pym-ini” for $10.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although, in a strange mystery twist, Disney News Site&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WDW News Today</a> screengrabbed a version of the menu last week that showed a fourth option.&nbsp;A medium-sized Pym-ini sandwich, priced at $57.99, offered little description other than the layout of the sandwich. It appears to have since been removed from the official menu.</p><p>The Pym Test Kitchen opens its doors on June 4, as does <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Disneyland California's Avengers Campus</a>. Other attractions include the Guardians of the Galaxy ride and a new attraction called WEB slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure.</p><p>The new campus will feature fresh food carts as well, including Shawarma Palace and Terran Treats. Fans can meet their favorite Marvel superheroes throughout Avengers Campus.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It has been a hard pandemic for the Walt Disney Company. According to the House of Mouse, COVID-19-related disruptions took a financial toll of more than it $1.4 billion in operating income in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the opening months of COVID alone</a>.&nbsp;Although making a meager, by their standards, profit of&nbsp;$460 million in that quarter, it was a stunning and sharp decline from the same quarter the year prior. With a slow and steady reopening this year, Disney has been banking on a return to normal to push their profits back to the days before the virus. With hundred dollar sandwiches, that might be a goal well within mouska-reach.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>New Disney Wish Cinderella Cruise Ship Being Called A "Castle On The Sea"</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNET</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Mag</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Travel Awaits</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8OiqqedqaGur7CMq5ysrJGqv6K602aqnqScnruoeZBpZ2arkaOxuLXCoWSfoaRis7C%2BjJpkn5mdnrm6ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
