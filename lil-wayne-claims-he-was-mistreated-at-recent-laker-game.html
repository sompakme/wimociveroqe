In November 2023, the New Orleans native called on his favorite team to trade the nine-time NBA All-Star.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Anthony Davis. If you’re asking me, if<a href=#> the Lakers</a> want to be a championship team, in the future as well, they got to get rid of AD. Because he’s AD, plain and simple,” Wayne stated. On another episode, the Carter V creator also said, “He ain’t done nothing for us, bro. That ‘bubble championship’ don’t count. That man has done nothing for the Lakers.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Despite him not having much faith in AD, Wayne has previously shared who he is expecting great things from this season: <a href=#>Stephen Curry.</a> While sitting courtside with his son, Kameron Carter, at a game last year, the two exchanged their NBA Finals predictions.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">&nbsp;“I’ve got the Bucks and Warriors,” the rapper said, before explaining why he isn’t ready to give any prediction that doesn’t involve&nbsp;Curry. “To me, counting Steph out is like how it used to feel when you’d count [Tom] Brady out.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Them Patriots years that you just thought they’re not going to be there, and then they’d be in the f**king Super Bowl. That’s how I be feeling about Steph. Every time I’m ready to say, ‘Yeah,&nbsp;<a href=#>Steph’s run</a>&nbsp;is over,’ that boy be right there in the Finals,” he continued.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6G2rXnWmrCnnV2YuaK1zKxkoZ1drK60ecyiqq2qlZbBprCMmqtmqpWYsq%2FAjKWYpJ2iYrSiucRmaGtrZG2Cd4OTamY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
