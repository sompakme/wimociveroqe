And just like that…you’ve come into your own with more confidence and wisdom than you had when you were younger. You’re in your prime!</p><p>And yet, it’s not so simple to shop for women in their 50s. There are countless gift guides for babies, children, even teens and 20-somethings. But what can you get the woman who probably has everything she needs? There’s where we come in!</p><h2><strong>How We Picked the Best Gifts for Women in Their 50s</strong></h2><p>We did extensive research to find out what items are flying off the shelves for women over 50, from targeted skincare to cozy staples and beautiful fashion. We even checked in with our favorite ladies who are 50, nifty and thrifty (note to self: need to copyright that immediately) for inspo. Whether you’re treating yourself or someone special in your life, these gifts are perfect for Generation X and Baby Boomers.</p><p>Now let’s dive into a deeper topic on a similar subject. According to the Mayo Clinic, the average age of menopause is 51 in the United States — and yet, this natural process is rarely spoken about publicly. “My mother started going through, I like to call it ‘the change,’ at 38. So, you know, a lot of people don’t like discussing it,” Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star <strong>Kathy Hilton</strong> exclusively told Us. “I remember her saying was, ‘I’m melting.’ She’d be putting makeup on and she’d have the fan. That’s not why I have the fan, if you know anything about me with the fan. The fan is so I can sleep. So I’ve had not hot flashes, but I am constantly warm. And then my hair gets all curly and I get headache-y and the sleep has been difficult for me.”</p><p>Keeping this info in mind, we also added products to the list that alleviate symptoms of menopause for women who are experiencing discomfort. We’re here for you!</p><p>Without further ado, we present to you our gift guide for females in their 50s and beyond. Happy shopping!</p><h4><strong>1.
