Guests will find a lobby full of garland, a full-size Christmas tree and a Glockenspiel that sings carols twice a day for pure <a href=#>holiday</a> enjoyment.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>HALLMARK CHANNEL TO LAUNCH RADIO STATION DEDICATED TO CHRISTMAS MUSIC</a></strong></p><p>All of the guest rooms and suites are decorated to the fullest. There is a "Sleep In Heavenly Peace" mattress in each room that comes with red velvet bedding, as well as reindeer sculptures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Visitors can even request the Santa Suite, which is precisely what it sounds like — a room devoted to the beloved jolly fat man who brings presents. There are pieces of St. Nick all over this fantastic room, including a fireplace and a special gift from Santa Claus himself.</p><p>The Inn at Christmas Place has been opened since 2007 and offers much more than just the holiday spirit. A full breakfast buffet, an indoor pool with a hot tub and an outdoor pool with a waterslide are all included with your nightly stay at the <a href=#>hotel</a>.</p><p>Plus, it is right next to The Incredible Christmas Place, which is a magical Christmas themed shopping area where guests can stock up on holiday goodies. Bakeries, specialty shops, and souvenir's and of course a giant Christmas tree are found in the shopping center that is also on the way to Dollywood.</p><p>Christmas is such a magical time of year; it is no wonder a resort themed to honor the holiday is a huge success. There is nothing wrong with looking for a little magic throughout the year. Honestly, it is a cool idea, but it kind of seems like a little too much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What do you think about The Inn at Christmas?
