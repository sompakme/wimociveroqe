The Real Housewives of New Jersey star, who has been candid about her plastic surgery and cosmetic procedures, just launched a pillow designed to make sleeping after having a little filler, lash lift or nip-and-tuck a heck of a lot more comfortable. 
“Everybody is getting botox and filler these days — even men,” Aydin, 44, tells Us Weekly in an exclusive interview."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And all of these beauty treatments have the same after care: not sleeping on your face.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RHONJ-Jennifer-Aydin-I-Cannot-Sleep-Without-My-New-Beauty-Pillow-Promo.jpg><p class=p1>So, while preventing lashes from bending and ensuring filler looks fab is the utmost priority, Aydin didn’t see why people — including her fellow castmates — had to pay the price of sleeping stiff, noting that most are “comfortable on their side.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The solution? The Ultimate Beauty Pillow, which “provides comfort and support” after a cosmetic procedure. Of course, Aydin also got a little help from her husband and plastic surgeon <strong>Dr. Bill Aydin</strong> — it’s even sold at his practice!<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The $49.99 pillow, which is designed to rest on top of your regular pillow, has been in the works for quite some time. In fact, the reality star has had prototypes of the pillow since her first season of RHONJ in 2017.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RHONJ-Jennifer-Aydin-I-Cannot-Sleep-Without-My-New-Beauty-Pillow-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>“I had it [The Ultimate Beauty Pillow] after my first year of being on the show and I had given it to all the girls as a <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a>,” she told Stylish. And, in the time that’s passed she’s even gotten the stamp of approval from her costars.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Aydin told Us: “<a href=#><strong>Melissa</strong></a> [Gorga] told me that she loves it. <a href=#><strong>Margaret</strong></a> [Josephs] told me that she used it after she had her face lift and it saved her — her exact words, I quote.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>But, Aydin doesn’t only use the pillow when in recovery-mode. In fact, it’s become a staple in her sleep routine. “It’s super soft and moldable and you just find your groove … I can’t sleep without it. I travel with it and take it everywhere I go,” the Bravo star told Stylish.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>And while the season 12 cast is unconfirmed, Aydin says that “if they have me back” and “allow me to showcase it,” Bravo watchers might a glimpse at some of the behind-the-scenes from her beauty business as she plans on “concentrating” on her business this summer.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The pillow is available for purchase on <a href=#>jenniferaydin.com</a>. <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5%2Byr7rIn5yrZZGusaq6jJyYp6xdqLmmsc9mrqKsmKTCtXnHnqlmrZyptq6t055km52RqsG6ec%2Bio6Wnp2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
