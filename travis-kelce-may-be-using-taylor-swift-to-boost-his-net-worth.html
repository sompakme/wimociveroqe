There’s no denying that Travis’ popularity has skyrocketed since being linked to the pop star earlier this month. Particularly, his jersey sales have spiked in demand.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">As per a TMZ Sports report</a>, Travis Kelce jerseys sales are experiencing a surge following Sunday's game. Fanatics, the NFL’s official e-commerce partner, informed TMZ that Kelce's NFL jerseys ranked among the top five best-selling in the last 24 hours, with a remarkable 400% in sales during that timeframe.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Taylor-Swift-VMAs-ring.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift's $12K Ring Appeared To Break At The VMAs</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift attended MTV's VMAs in September, and made the news for something other than her record-breaking Eras tour.</span><p>"Yesterday, Travis Kelce was one of the top 5 selling NFL players and saw a nearly 400% spike in sales throughout the Fanatics network of sites, including NFLShop.com," Fanatics explained to the publication.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though it’s unclear exactly what drove the spike in purchases, the surge in jersey sales coincides with Taylor's visit to Arrowhead Stadium to witness the Chiefs' commanding 41-10 victory over the Bears, where she was seen bonding with Travis’ mom while cheering him on.</p><p>While the pair seem to be going strong, there’s more adding fuel to the rumors that Travis is hoping for a career boost thanks to Taylor - Travis’ ex-girlfriend Maya Benberry recently issued a public warning to the singer, suggesting, Travis could be dating her mainly for clout.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screen-shot-2023-10-21-at-12-15-24-pm.png> Travis Kelce on the red carpet&nbsp; <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Taylor seems like such a fun girl with a beautiful spirit so I wish her the best of luck but I wouldn’t be a girls' girl if I didn’t advise her to be smart!” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maya told Daily Mail.</a> “I’m sure by now she has mastered the ability to see who is really there for her - and who is just using her,” she went on. “I can only hope that she comes out the teacher in this situation and not the student.”</p><p>Even more, Maya implied that Tavis has a history of infidelity in relationships. “The man that I knew him to be when we dated,” she continued. “Only time will tell but like the saying always goes, once a cheater, always a cheater.”</p><p>Maya and Travis' romantic relationship lasted a mere two months after she emerged as the winner on "Catching Kelce," a reality show featuring 49 other contestants representing all 50 states competing for the affections of the NFL player. Following their breakup in 2016, Maya posted a series of tweets, which have since been deleted, implying that Travis had been unfaithful to her with sports broadcaster Kayla Nicole, who he dated up until last year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Travis Kelce's net worth</a> is reportedly $30 million, while <a href=#>Taylor Swift's net worth is reportedly $740 million</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmraqRq7a0ecqeo5ydXarAqrrGZquasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWSpLy0wIynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMo5yrq5WuerSty56qZqugnrimsI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
