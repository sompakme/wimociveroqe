The more time a doctor has put in, the more experience they have, giving us patients a little more faith. Included among the following medical professionals are surgeons, physicians, an obstetrician, gynaecologist, an allergist, a rheumatologist and a paediatrician. What they all share in common is the passion and enthusiasm they have for their work, so much so that they all decided work until the last possible day that they could. Some of them worked into their hundreds, a couple of which continue to do so. Those who have since passed on worked up until a short time before their death.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is no place for boredom in the lives of these truly inspiring doctor’s. Their stories will not only leave you feeling like the world is your oyster, but they serve as a poignant reminder that anything is possible. Age is but a number in the minds of these great professionals who have not allowed anything or anyone to prevent them from excelling in their respective fields and delivering superb care to thousands of patients.</p><h2 id=10-dr-b-j-masakorala-85><strong>10. Dr. B.J. Masakorala, 85</strong></h2><p>via:www.ft.lk</p><p>Dr. B.J. Masakorala was honoured with an honorary fellowship of the College of Surgeons of Sri Lanka in 2013 for his exceptional contribution to the field of surgery, surgical training and international surgical leadership. Now at the age of 85, the Daily FT ( their local paper) has stated that Masakorala only carries out minor procedures leaving major surgeries to his trusted colleagues and students. In a statement to the Daily FT, he said he believes working at a time when the advancements in technology were not readily available enabled him to gain unique experience. He performed surgery on many film industry personalities, including the late Sir Arthur C. Clarke. Having carried out over 2,000 goitre surgeries, among many others Masakorala now likes to spend the majority of his time teaching young medical students.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-dr-carrol-frazier-landrum-88><strong>9. Dr. Carrol Frazier Landrum, 88</strong></h2><p>via:www.thetoc.gr</p><p>Eighty-eight year old Dr. Carrol Frazier Landrum is a true hero in the eyes of many citizens of Edwards, Mississippi. Dubbed ‘the travelling doctor’ Frazier believes everybody is entitled to medical assistance, especially those who are living in poverty and unable to afford medical help. According to a recent article in the Washington Post, Frazier treats a number of people from his car, whether it is on the side of the road or in a local parking lot. Due to the manner in which he sees his patients, the State’s Board of Medical Licensure has asked him to surrender his license. However, the people of Mississippi do not want to see their beloved doctor go and have set up a petition on thepetitionsite.com in response to the Board’s request.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-dr-russell-dohner-88><strong>8.

Retiring at 88 years old in 2013, he is&nbsp;a&nbsp;treasured member of the local community. According to examiner.com,&nbsp;Dr. Dohner had been providing the town’s residents with quality medical care for a mere $5 a visit for three decades. If his patients could not&nbsp;afford the $5, he&nbsp;would&nbsp;happily see them anyway. Dohner&nbsp;took&nbsp;his oath very seriously, stating in an interview with BBC News that he didn’t go into medicine to make money; ‘I wanted to be a doctor, taking care of people.’ Amazingly, he worked&nbsp;up until 88, seven days a week alongside his 85 year old nurse Rose Busby and 84 year old receptionist, Edith Moore who hand wrote all of the records. The inspirational trio kept the community going for decades, saving many lives along the way.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-dr-fred-goldman-101><strong>7.

According to cincinnati.com, his philosophy was a nurturing, caring one as he believed the doctor/patient relationship was a collaborative one. His unremitting dedication to his profession was followed on after his death in October 2012 when his body was donated to the University of Cincinnati’s College of Medicine. His son, Mike Goldman told cincinnati.com that his father ‘wanted his body to be used as a cadaver for first-year medical students.’</p><p></p><h2 id=6-dr-shigeaki-hinohara-102><strong>6.

Dr. Alfred William Frankland, 102</strong></h2><p>via:www.youtube.com</p><p>Known as the grandfather of allergy, Dr. Bill Frankland has made extraordinary contributions to medicine throughout his career pioneering the very first double-blind randomized control trial on allergen immunotherapy. He has been&nbsp;so dedicated to&nbsp;understanding and treating allergies, that he would inject himself with different insect venom to simulate allergic reactions in order to understand what his patients experienced during an allergic reaction. Frankland worked alongside Professor Alexander Fleming who famously discovered penicillin in 1929. At 102 years of age, Frankland continues to practice as a physician and publish papers, five of which were published in 2014. Frankland has stated that he has no intentions of retiring: “I like to work. I like people. I like to see patients.

According to the Telegraph UK, the renowned cardiothoracic surgeon retired at the age of&nbsp;102. Uglov was highly regarded within his field and won the Lenin Prize in 1961 for developing surgical methods for the treatment of lung disease and implementing them in clinical practice. Uglov, who lived to be 103, was a right-wing teetotaller who condemned drinking and smoking. He became a prolific writer in the later years of his life. The BMJ state that he condemned ‘abortions, rock and roll music, market reforms, and advertising’ even going so far as to argue that media should be under state control.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-ephraim-p-engleman-103><strong>2.
