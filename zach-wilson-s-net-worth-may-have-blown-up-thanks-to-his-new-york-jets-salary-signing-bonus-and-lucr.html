The average salary for an NFL quarterback in 2023 is $25 million. The highest-paid quarterback is Aaron Rodgers, who is set to make $50 million in 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zach Wilson is one of the youngest quarterbacks in the NFL, and he's already made a lot of money. <a href=#>He grew up relatively wealthy</a>, but his rocky start in the NFL has netted him millions. Wilson is still a young quarterback, but he has the potential to be one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in the NFL in the future. He has the talent and the work ethic to be a successful NFL quarterback, and he is just getting started.</p><p>Despite the struggles he's had on the field (and some of the struggles he's had off the field), Wilson's net worth has actually increased during his time in the NFL. Some of this has to do with how contracts are structured, but there have been some other factors that have played into this situation. Here's everything to know.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-did-zach-wilson-earn-from-his-rookie-contract>How Much Money Did Zach Wilson Earn From His Rookie Contract?</h2><p>According to ESPN, Zach Wilson is projected to earn $37 million from his rookie contract. This includes his signing bonus, salary, and roster bonuses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/how-zach-wilson-s-girlfriend-nicolette-dellanno-really-makes-all-her-money.jpg><p>It is important to note that these are just projections. The actual amount of money that Wilson earns could change depending on how he performs on the field, if at all. For example, if he has a breakout season in 2022, he could earn more money in roster bonuses and incentives.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tom Brady And Gisele Bundchen Lose A Fortune In Crypto Endorsement, And Might Have To Pay Millions In Taxes</a></span></p><p>However, even if Wilson does not have a breakout season, he is still guaranteed to earn over $35 million from his rookie contract. This is a significant amount of money for a young player, and it will help him to establish himself financially.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/zach-wilson-and-tom-brady.jpg><p>It is also worth noting that Wilson's rookie contract is fully guaranteed. This means that even if he is cut by the Jets before the end of his contract, he will still be entitled to all the guaranteed money. This is a rare occurrence in the NFL, and it is a testament to Wilson's potential.</p><p>As for how his net worth has increased year-by-year despite his off-the-field issues <a href=#>and odd relationship history</a>, part of that does have to do with how NFL contracts are structured. Due to the risk of injury and inflation, most NFL contracts are back-loaded, as in they increase over time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This makes it fair to the players, who could get released at any time at the mercy of the owners. It also makes it fair to the owners, who aren't affected by the contract being back-loaded because of factors such as inflation. The less guaranteed money a contract has, the better it is for the owners as well.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-has-zach-wilson-made-from-his-endorsement-deals-with-nike-and-chipotle>How Much Money Has Zach Wilson Made From His Endorsement Deals With Nike And Chipotle?</h2><p>The biggest endorsement deal Wilson's made has been with the fashion giant Nike. According to Sportskeeda, Wilson signed a multi-year endorsement deal with Nike in 2021. The terms of the deal have not been disclosed, but it is believed to be worth several million dollars according to Forbes. Wilson also signed an endorsement deal with Chipotle in 2021 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and had his own menu item back in 2021</a>.</p><p>While it's not known how much money has been made, considering he's the new face of the franchise, he may have made a couple hundred thousand dollars from the hit fast-food company. Wilson's also had deals with companies such as Aptive Environmental, Bose, and Trager Grills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/zach-wilson.jpg><p>In total, Wilson is estimated to have made at least $5 million from his endorsement deals. This is a significant amount of money for a young player, and it is a testament to his marketability.</p><p>Even if Wilson does not become a superstar, he is still likely to make a significant amount of money from his endorsement deals. He is a good-looking, charismatic young man with a strong social media presence. These qualities are attractive to brands, and they will likely help Wilson secure lucrative endorsement deals in the future.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Zach Wilson's Girlfriend Nicolette Dellanno Really Makes All Her Money</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to his endorsement deals, Wilson also has the potential to make money from other sources, such as speaking engagements, autograph signings, and memorabilia sales. If he continues to perform well on the field, he could become one of the most marketable athletes in the NFL. This would mean that he could make even more money from his endorsement deals and other business ventures.</p><h2 id=is-zach-wilson-going-to-play-football-in-2023>Is Zach Wilson Going To Play Football In 2023?</h2><p>Zach Wilson is still under contract with the New York Jets for the 2023 season, so he is expected to play football. However, he is currently the backup quarterback to Aaron Rodgers, so it is unclear how much playing time he will see.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything To Know About Aaron Rodgers' Fascinating Girlfriend Blu Of Earth</a></span></p><p>Being a backup quarterback will likely have a negative impact on Wilson's net worth. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Sports Illustrated, he will earn less money in salary</a>, and he will also have fewer opportunities to earn money from endorsements and other business ventures. Additionally, being a backup quarterback could damage his reputation and make it more difficult for him to become a starter in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/zach-wilson-s-net-worth-grew-substantially-after-his-salary-playing-qb-for-the-new-york-jets.jpg><p>However, there are also some potential benefits to being a backup quarterback.</p><p>Wilson will have the opportunity to learn from one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL, and he will also have a chance to prove himself when Rodgers is not playing. If Wilson can perform well as a backup, he could eventually become the starter for the Jets or another team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/nicolette-dellanno-and-zach-wilson.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Overall, it is too early to say how being a backup quarterback will affect Wilson's net worth. However, it is likely that his earnings will decrease in the short term. However, if he can learn from Rodgers and improve his game, he could eventually become a starter and earn more money.</p><p>He'll play back-up this year, and then likely be traded or released in the final year of his rookie contract, 2024. He would be missing out on a potential $9 million if that were to happen, per BetMGM. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He could be traded</a> to the Tennessee Titans, Las Vegas Raiders, or the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which result in a small contract not nearly on the level of his rookie deal. Time will tell where Wilson ends up next.</p><p>If all else fails, Wilson could become a sports analyst or actor. He wouldn't be the first NFL player to <a href=#>make the transition from the gridiron to Hollywood</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGixmpuYYsSquNKopaxlnprBbsPOq6uhZZ6axG7FzquiZqKVqcBuv8ClmKuxXZq7pbvRrJymnZ6peqWxwKWqaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
