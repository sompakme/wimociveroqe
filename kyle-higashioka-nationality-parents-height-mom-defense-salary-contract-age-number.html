From a squatting position, he can make quick lateral movements that most catchers would probably struggle to pull off. As a result, Higgy has an easier time deadening the ball and keeping it in front of him.</p><p>Higashioka’s defense skills and tactics are seamless in the sense that, locking and framing skills are important tools for New York’s catchers, who must handle pitches that exhibit unpredictable, abrupt movement.</p><p>To say that&nbsp;Higashioka&nbsp;excels at pitch framing is an understatement. He’s the best pitch framer in the majors this year, according to Baseball Prospectus’ called strikes above average (CSAA) metric.</p><p>Higgy also ranks among the top third of MLB catchers in converting a batter’s non-swing pitches into called strikes, for pitches located in what Baseball Savant refers to as the “Shadow Zone”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kyle-higashioka-salary></span><strong>Kyle Higashioka Salary</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kyle Higashioka has a net worth of $ 1million with an annual salary of $ 500K.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kyle-higashioka-contract></span><strong>Kyle Higashioka Contract&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kyle signed a 1-year contract with the Yankees worth $594,000&nbsp; in 2021 with $594,000 as guaranteed, and an annual average salary of $594,000.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kyle-higashioka-age></span><strong>Kyle Higashioka Age&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Higashioka was born on April 20, 1990, making him 31 years of age.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kyle-higashioka-number></span><strong>Kyle Higashioka Number</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kyle wears number 66 on his baseball jersey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKOpobJutMigmKygmaS4onnNmquip56WuarA2GanmqqVo8G0eceeoKCgpGK6sLmMnZyfnZ6osm6%2FwKWYq7FdmLyvwNGamq1lkZyybrrUppmeql1nfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
