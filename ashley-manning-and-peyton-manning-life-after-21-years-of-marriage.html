Her degree in Marketing and Finance from the University of Virginia adds to her accolades.</p><p>Peyton describes her as the most thoughtful person he knows – high praises indeed!</p><p>The NFL player stated that Ashley earned As in school in the 2000 book “Manning: A Father, His Sons, and a Football Legacy” that he co-authored with his father.</p><p>Ashley increased her <a href=#>business</a> knowledge when she joined the Memphis Grizzlies, a National Basketball Association team in Tennessee, as a minority owner in 2012.</p><p>She wanted the Grizzlies to stay in Tennessee and positively impact the neighborhood, which inspired her to join the ownership group.</p><p>Throughout their lives, they had always supported each other’s work.

But kept it under wraps so it wouldn’t become news during football season.</p><p>The couple wed on St. Patrick’s Day in 2001. And they took a week off work for their honeymoon. However, they kept their destination a secret.</p><p>The wedding surprised many of his fans because they had kept their engagement a secret; his father, the former New Orleans Saints quarterback Archie Manning, said more than 500 people were in attendance.</p><p>Peyton Manning, Marshall Manning, Mosley Manning, and Brandon Stokely at the Ring of Honour induction ceremony on October 31, 2021, in Denver | Source: Getty Images</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Peyton and Ashley Manning’s Children</h2><p>Ashley and Peyton welcomed their twins, boy Marshall Williams Manning and daughter Mosley Thompson Manning, two weeks after celebrating their tenth wedding anniversary.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCt0qGjnrFdoq6vusinnmaola7BsLqMppinppmjtHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
