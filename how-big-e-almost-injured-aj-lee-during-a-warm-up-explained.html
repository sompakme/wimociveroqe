It's just so hard not to smile when he would come out, scream, and shake his booty. However, just because he's one of the most beloved, it doesn't mean he's immune to mistakes and a little ribbing. That was proven the night after WrestleMania 29 when Big E had a very minor goof up and AJ Lee decided to have a little fun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Things Fans Should Know About Big E's Life Outside WWE</a></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/custom-dimensions-1400x700-px-126.jpeg><h2 id=aj-lee-dolph-ziggler-and-big-e-were-a-three-person-faction-in-2013>AJ Lee, Dolph Ziggler, And Big E Were A Three Person Faction In 2013</h2><p>Before Big E shot up to super stardom as the powerhouse of positivity in The New Day, he was booked as a boring, vanilla strong man for Dolph Ziggler and AJ Lee, and also had a last name in Langston. Dolph and AJ were in a relationship which started at TLC 2012 when <a href=#>AJ cost John Cena a ladder match</a> for Dolph's Money in the Bank contract.</p><p>They played a couple, but Dolph felt he needed a little protection. Therefore, Big E was called up from NXT to be that muscle. Unfortunately for Big E, that's all he was. He had muscles, lots of them, but nothing else. <a href=#>The charisma that he exuded in the New Day </a>was nowhere to be found. This group wasn't anything spectacular, and it showed as their biggest moment was a WrestleMania tag title loss to Team Hell No.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/custom-dimensions-1400x700-px-128.jpeg><h2 id=big-e-accidentally-hit-aj-lee-during-his-entrance>Big E Accidentally Hit AJ Lee During His Entrance</h2><p>The Raw the night after WrestleMania 29 is most remembered for the crowd taking over the show. They just chant the most random stuff during every match and segment, and they get themselves over. John Cena knew how to play with them, but nobody else did. However, the show is also remembered as the night <a href=#>Dolph Ziggler cashed in on Alberto Delrio</a> to win the World Heavyweight Champion as the crowd went nuts, <a href=#>which practically turned him into a babyface until the official double turn at Payback.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>John Cena & AJ Lee: One Of WWE's Most Bizarre Relationships Ever, Explained</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before that happened though, Dolph walked out with Big E for a match against Daniel Bryan. Obviously, AJ joined the two of them. Now, Big E was still fresh from his call-up. The match at Wrestlemania was his first main roster match. Therefore, he wasn't used to the larger ramp and having people walking right behind him. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He started swinging his arms violently back and forth as he did in NXT, and accidentally walloped AJ Lee right in the neck and chest</a>. Most would think that AJ went down like a ton of bricks, but she took it like a trooper and continued walking. It didn't seem to affect her one bit, and Big E just stayed in character, or lack thereof, and patted her on the back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/custom-dimensions-1400x700-px-125.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=big-e-felt-terribly-sorry-so-aj-lee-played-a-little-prank-on-him>Big E Felt Terribly Sorry, So AJ Lee Played A Little Prank On Him</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AJ Lee has gone on to talk about the incident.</a> She explained that she was forced to wear a padded bra during her performances, and that padded bra is what saved her from being hurt. Well, Big E wasn't exactly in the know about this, and when the group got to the back, he was "on the verge of tears." AJ described Big E as a "gentle giant," so with this man having no idea if he actually hurt her or not, begging for forgiveness, and apologizing intensely, what else wass there to do than to play into it?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why AJ Lee Retired From WWE & What She's Done Since Retirement, Explained</a></span></p><p>AJ Lee would tell Big E that she was legitimately hurt, and she let the charade go on for a week. She told him that she needed to see a doctor, that her sternum was broken, and that she couldn't even reach for a glass of water. She eventually told him that she was fine, and at the end of the day, it was just a friendly little joke, but poor Big E must've been in dire straits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/custom-dimensions-1400x700-px-127.jpeg><p>It ain't ballet. That's what they say about professional wrestling because anything and everything can happen at any given time without a moment's notice. <a href=#>Unfortunately for Big E himself, he felt that firsthand when his neck got broken last March.</a> Regardless, that any given time truly means any given time because usually the unexpected happens in the ring, but the entrance ramp has had its fair share of goofs, and this one ended up being a fun and cute story. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Well, not for Big E who said that this situation was, "one of the most frightening moments" in his career.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenrLJursigZJ5lkaG6sL%2FTZqCnoqWnsqV5wKNkpZ2VYrG2vsinnmavkae6bsHPaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
