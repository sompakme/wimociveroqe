The reigning AEW World Champion went down with a foot injury just a few days after he won the gold at AEW Double or Nothing. On the June 3 edition of AEW Rampage, he announced that he needed surgery. Since then, the timeframe for his recovery and return has been unclear.
Speaking with Skewed and Reviewed Gareth Von Kallenbach at the San Diego Comic-Con, “The Second City Saint” was asked about his injury."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He responded by noting that while it’s frustrating, he’s getting better, and he hopes to be back soon.</p><p>“It’s healing, [but] it’s not healed,” said Punk. “That’s a quote from my surgeon. It feels like it’s on fire every day, partly probably because I was on my feet all day yesterday. Still wear the boot, but that’s mostly because I want people to recognize that I don’t want them near my foot. I’m working hard to come back. It’s just a s—– injury, not being able to walk and my entire calf on that side kinda shut down, so learning how to walk again is f—— frustrating. But better than I was yesterday, I’ll be better tomorrow, and hopefully I’ll see everybody soon.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJpcHBraWKwrnnPrqWkZZmjt7a%2B2GasqZyRqbJuw86roqKml2K1or7DZquoZZOkuqZ5wZqapA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
