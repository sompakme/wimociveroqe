But watch it and you’re totally captivated. Why might you not initially be convinced? The film has no dialogue. Directed by and starring <a href=#>John Krasinski</a>, it’s about a family living in a post-apocalyptic world where, if you make even the slightest sound, blind&nbsp;aliens with a&nbsp;very sharp sense of hearing will attack and kill you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Cast Member Of The Office Net Worth</a>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Released in 2018, the film features only a handful of actors, including Krasinski, Emily Blunt, who plays his wife (and to whom he’s married in real life), and their three kids.
