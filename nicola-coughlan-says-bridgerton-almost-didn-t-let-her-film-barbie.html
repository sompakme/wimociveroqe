The actress, however, revealed in a Friday, March 22, interview on the Irish edition of The Late Late Show that her Bridgerton schedule almost kept her from appearing in Barbie at all.
“I was about to film Bridgerton and Bridgerton were like, ‘You can’t go and film an entire movie, by the way,’” she recalled."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She was then cast as Penelope Featherington on Bridgerton, a role she has played since 2020. The first half of Bridgerton season 3 is due to release on May 16, with the second half coming June 13.</p><p>Again showing her versatility, Coughlan is working on more than just Bridgerton right now. She’s also starring in the six-part comedy series Big Mood, which premieres this week in Ireland.</p><p>“I’m so insanely proud of it,” Coughlan <a href=# rel=noopener>told the Irish Mirror</a>. “It’s the most personally invested I’ve ever been in anything that I’ve ever worked on. Because it is written by one of my best friends and it’s got so much meaning behind it. I think it’s so funny.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKWim5%2Bhrm6vzq6eoaSRo3q0rdisZJuqmZm0pr7TqKVmmZyivLTAjJ2gnaakYrmmwIyhnKtllp65rnnBmqmboZVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
