While attending high school, Tony excelled at football and basketball and earned several All-American distinctions.&nbsp;</p><p>After being drafted in the first round of the 1997 <a href=#>NFL</a> Draft by the Chiefs, Tony went on to enjoy tremendous career success over his 12-season tenure in the National Football League (NFL).</p><p>Tony’s personal life is equally successful – not only has he been in a relationship with October for about 15 years, but he also had two adopted children from his previous relationship with entertainment reporter Lauren Sanchez.&nbsp;</p><p>All five of them share a house together in Huntington Beach, California; a happy family indeed!</p><p>Tony and his partner have long been advocates for a healthy lifestyle, particularly when it comes to nutrition. Tony, with this diet in mind, was actually able to help himself overcome a battle with facial paralysis known as Bell’s Palsy.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the couple does not often appear together in work-related events, both have achieved their share of successes when it comes to hosting programs or advocating for a cause.</p><p>Ever loyal, they strive to support each other in every way they can, including offering each other advice regularly.</p><p>By embracing a healthy diet and lifestyle, they remain steady in their commitment towards bettering themselves over time!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>About October Calinda&nbsp;</h2><p>October Calinda Vegas-Russell had a passion for entertaining and creating from an early age, growing up in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>This passion led her to pursue a career in television, eventually leading her to host two shows; “Beat Shazam,” where contestants compete against each other to identify hit songs as quickly as possible and is also well known for co-hosting the show “Rachael Ray,” several times.&nbsp;</p><p>She met Tony Gonzales when she started hosting Beat Shazam, who was a professional American football player at that time. The two of them later married in 2016, solidifying Vegas-Russell’s already impressive track record.</p><p>They have been working together on various projects since then and often appear in public or on television together because of their strong relationship.</p><p>October is a remarkable role model and an incredible individual, all wrapped into one. Not only is she talented on-screen, but she also has a strong and passionate streak that makes her involved in charitable activities.</p><p>As one of the hosts and DJs of the TV game show “Beat Shazam,” October has certainly made a mark in the entertainment industry. The show – which features actor Jamie Foxx as its main host and executive producer – pits two contestants against each other to identify a series of songs for cash prizes, challenging them to name six songs before the Shazam app can do so.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, October is heavily involved with PETA, nearly having an ad campaign with the organization dedicated to animal rights back in 2009.</p><p>She also held a special event called Pink Party at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta to honor teenagers facing cancer – showing that her ability to entertain shines even brighter when it comes to initiatives for social change.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>October Calinda’s Networth&nbsp;</h2><p>Since late 2018, the public has been informed of a net worth hovering around $1 million, which has primarily come from her successful work in television. Additionally, her husband’s estimated wealth of over $30 million has also contributed to boosting this number.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking forward to 2019 and beyond, she is projected to continue amassing more wealth due to further success in her career. With numbers like that, it’s evident that she is a woman who knows how to make money.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is she active on Social Media?</h2><p>Popular television personality October is no stranger to social media. She has several accounts on sites like Twitter and Instagram, where she promotes her latest endeavors and posts personal photos of herself and her family.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it seems as though she put a pause on her Twitter activity back in 2017, not posting anything since then.</p><p>We hope this isn’t the end of her Twitter account because it was an excellent platform for her fans to garner information about her life and professional updates.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDAzqewZp%2Bfo8eiuMSsZLChlpp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
