Some are even considered to be villains in the grand love story of Ross and Rachel. These ex-girlfriends include Chloe "the hot Xerox girl" and British Emily. Other romances of Ross's were solely used for comedic effect, like his lesbian ex-wife and several short hookups. Here is what all of Ross Geller's ex-girlfriends look like today.</p><h2 id=ross-39-ex-wife-carol-willick-played-by-anita-barone><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Ross' Ex-Wife, Carol Willick Played By Anita Barone</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/unknown.jpeg><p>Carol Willick was <a href=#>Ross Geller</a>'s ex-wife. When Friends began, they had just gotten divorced due to Carol's realization that she was a lesbian. Carol and Ross are forced to remain in each other's lives, however, when Carol discovers that she is pregnant with Ross's child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The character Carol is first seen in the second episode of the first season. In the episode, Anita Barone played Ross's ex-wife. After that, however, the character was recast and Jane Sibbett took over the role of Carol.</p><h2 id=ross-39-fling-with-chandler-39-s-mom-nora-tyler-bing-played-by-morgan-fairchild><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Ross' Fling With Chandler's Mom, Nora Tyler Bing Played By Morgan Fairchild</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar52513399.jpg><p>Though not technically a relationship, Ross Geller did have an intimate moment with Chandler's mom Nora Tyler Bing. The two shared a kiss and were caught by Joey.

Though Rachel had finally learned of Ross' feelings for her, and had realized she had feelings for him, Ross came back from China with a new girlfriend: Julie.</p><p>Fans were frustrated by the complication, as they wanted Ross and Rachel to get together. They would have to wait a while, even after Julie was eventually out of the picture. Julie was played by Lauren Tom, who is also popular for her role of Linda Tran on the CW's Supernatural.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/did-matt-leblanc-ever-feud-with-david-schwimmer-and-matthew-perry-during-their-time-on-friends_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Matt LeBlanc Ever Feud With David Schwimmer And Matthew Perry During Their Time On Friends?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer portrayed best friends but they may not have gotten along all the time behind the scenes.</span><h2 id=ross-39-hookup-girl-chloe-quot-the-hot-xerox-girl-quot-played-by-angela-featherstone><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Ross' Hookup Girl Chloe "The Hot Xerox Girl" Played By Angela Featherstone</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/unknown-1.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The biggest villain of them all. Though Ross Geller never technically dated Chloe, also known as "the hot Xerox girl," their night together had major consequences. Ross slept with Chloe while he thought he was on a break from his relationship with Rachel Green. The debate of whether or not they were actually on a break was ongoing on Friends, and continues to be discussed by fans today.</p><p>Angela Featherstone played Chloe, and she has potentially changed the most over the years when compared to Ross's other ex-girlfriends.</p><h2 id=ross-39-girlfriend-bonnie-played-by-christine-taylor><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ross' Girlfriend Bonnie Played By Christine Taylor</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ben-stiller-christine-taylor.jpg><p>Bonnie and Ross Geller were set up by Phoebe after Rachel gave Phoebe the all-clear.
