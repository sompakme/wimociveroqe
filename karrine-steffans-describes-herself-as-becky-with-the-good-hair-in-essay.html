And most of that talk has come from her track, “Sorry,” which mysteriously references a woman who might’ve had an affair with Bey’s husband, Jay Z, “Becky with the good hair.” While the Beyhive has put on their detective caps to find the mysterious woman, pointing fingers at Rachel Roy and Rita Ora, it seems that the search might&nbsp;be over. <a href=# id=auto-tag_karrine-steffans_1 data-tag=karrine-steffans>Karrine Steffans</a>, also known as “<a href=# id=auto-tag_superhead_1 data-tag=superhead>Superhead</a>,” came forward in an essay, admitting that she is in fact Becky with the good hair.</p><p>In the lengthy essay entitled, “I Am Becky With the Good Hair,” the former video vixen details her relations with Jay Z. After bizarrely quoting Zora Neale Hurston in the first line and then describing the embodiment of a woman, Steffans&nbsp;recounts a time she spent with Jay Z in a Maybach almost two decades prior.&nbsp;“Over 15 years ago, I had <a href=# id=auto-tag_beyonce_1 data-tag=beyonce>Beyoncé</a>’s husband. Yes, I was one of Jay Z’s Beckys back in the year 2000 for about three minutes, which is about as long it takes me to satisfy a man in the back of a Maybach while overlooking the beaches of Malibu,” says the former video vixen.</p><p>Steffans admits that her affairs with Jay Z were before the Roc-a-fella mogul and Bey got together, but according to her, “a Becky is a Becky, and I was&nbsp;the&nbsp;Becky for many men. They were all my salvation and my destitution. They were my reason and my rationale, my life and my death, and eventually, my fame and my infamy,” she wrote.</p><p>The essay then takes a step away from Beyonce and Jay Z’s love to her own marital struggles. She begins talking about her three failed marriages, ending with her most recent relationship with actor, Columbus Short.&nbsp;&nbsp;The two married after a brief period of dating in January 2016 and separated shortly after when a video surfaced of Steffans confronting Columbus about his infidelity. She filed a restraining order on him as well.</p><p>“I married a man with&nbsp;addictions and emotional afflictions. I did everything I could to get him help. His mother and I talked tirelessly about the resources available to us and how to get him to take advantage of them. But, he never did and I hurt myself trying,” she wrote. “The alcohol, the cocaine,&nbsp;the other women, it all became too much and I raged.&nbsp;I cried.&nbsp;I mourned and still mourn the loss of my husband, my friend, my confidant.”</p><p>The rest of the essay goes into a longwinded dissection of men, infidelity, and women’s roles in those situations. She ended the open letter with a confusing analogy, tying herself to Beyonce, and all women. “I am Becky with the good hair. I am&nbsp;Beyoncé. I am the keeper of secrets, the betrayer of women, the confessor of my sins, the owner of my secrets, lies and salvations. I have traded in my Scarlet A for a Scarlet Bey.”</p><p>Check out Karrine Steffans’ full essay <a href=# rel=nofollow>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Cus77Ip5xmq6Sas6etzaxkm52ToMZuw8itn2asmJp6qLvOnWShmZmneqa%2F0pqwZmxhboBzfI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
