Over the years, it has been one of the most vital shows on the <a href=#>WWE</a> calendar. At best, it’s a mini-WrestleMania, and at worst, it’s just one of the big four. SummerSlam has earned this reputation by delivering great cards, which are typically headlined by special main events.</p><p>Ahead of the thirty-sixth SummerSlam, let’s take a look at the best main events in the history of the show. These matches aren’t just graded on in-ring action. Other factors, including storyline, hype, historical significance, and personal bias also came into play.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>The Rock vs. Brock Lesnar (2002)</h2><p>WWE quickly built Brock Lesnar up as the next big thing upon his arrival. He earned a world title shot by winning the King of the Ring tournament. Meanwhile, The Rock won the WWE Undisputed Championship by defeating Kurt Angle and The Undertaker at WWE Vengeance 2003. As a result, the stage was set for a major showdown at SummerSlam.</p><p>“The People’s Champion” and the young powerhouse then clashed in a thrilling main event. Paul Heyman got involved and took a Rock Bottom through the announce table for his troubles. In the end, Lesnar was unstoppable, as he beat The Rock to win the gold. The victory set a new record for the youngest WWE Champion and cemented Lesnar’s status as a top star. Over two decades later, he remains one of the biggest names in the business, and it all started here. The match also marked the end of an era as The Rock continued his transition into Hollywood.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>John Cena vs. Daniel Bryan (2013)</h2><p>Like John Cena’s classic 2011 feud with CM Punk, his rivalry with Daniel Bryan was a fascinating clash. Cena was the typical WWE star; he was everything the company usually looked for. On the other hand, in many ways, Bryan was the opposite. Still, there was no denying that the fans were already rallying around Bryan in 2013. The “Yes!” Movement kicked into high gear in 2014. That being said, Bryan was already a strong underdog that had plenty of support from the crowd.</p><p>The storyline ahead of the bout wasn’t the strongest, as Cena, the WWE Champion, chose to face Bryan, who then had to deal with Mr. McMahon berating him. The bout received more intrigue when Triple H inserted himself as the special referee. As for the main event itself, Bryan and Cena made magic together. The thrilling conclusion saw Bryan pin Cena with a running knee. The post-match angle broke everyone’s hearts, as Triple H dropped Bryan with a Pedigree. Randy Orton then twisted the knife by cashing in his Money in the Bank contract to win the gold.</p><p>The contest helped prove that Cena was more than capable of having great matches. It also firmly established that Bryan deserved to be a main-eventer, even if WWE didn’t fully see it yet.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Bret Hart vs. The British Bulldog (1992)</h2><p>Any list of great WWE SummerSlam matches has to include the unforgettable bout between Bret Hart and Davey Boy Smith. SummerSlam 1992 was held at Wembley Stadium, the massive London arena that seats over 80,000 fans. The event marked WWE’s first major pay-per-view outside of North America, and the clash between Hart and Smith was the perfect headliner.</p><p>Fueled by a hot London crowd, Smith emerged victorious, as he beat Hart to win the Intercontinental title. Their excellent match is not only considered one of the best SummerSlam matches of all time. It’s often looked at as one of the greatest bouts in WWE history.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Brock Lesnar vs. The Undertaker (2015)</h2><p>Many major blockbusters have sequels, and that was the case with Brock Lesnar’s battle with The Undertaker at WrestleMania 30. “The Beast Incarnate” was responsible for one of the most shocking moments in WWE history when he beat The Streak. The win launched Lesnar to new heights, and he went on to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.</p><p>Lesnar later lost the title, and like a ghost, The Undertaker came back for revenge as he cost Lesnar the chance to regain the gold. Given their remarkable WrestleMania match, the SummerSlam bout sparked plenty of buzz. The rematch didn’t quite live up to WrestleMania. However, the two stars delivered a heart-pounding contest. In the end, Lesnar flipped the legend off right before he passed out to the Hell’s Gate. Given the star power and the hype surrounding the bout, it certainly deserves a spot here.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Steve Austin vs. The Undertaker (1998)</h2><p>WWE often likes to promote SummerSlam and its main events like summer blockbusters. It doesn’t get much bigger than “Stone Cold” Steve Austin battling The Undertaker in 1998. “The Texas Rattlesnake” and WWE as a whole were red-hot in 1998. Austin was the biggest star in wrestling, and the Attitude Era was heating up more by the day.</p><p>The creative was also impressively strong, as Austin’s title reign was tied into the long-running story between Undertaker and Kane. These ingredients combined for a special matchup, which headlined the show at Madison Square Garden.</p><p>It wasn’t a technical masterpiece, but it was a fun Attitude Era main event between two of the top names in the game. Looking back on it now, Austin vs. Undertaker feels like a match that fans would play on WWE 2K. Lucky for the WWE Universe, they actually got to see it in 1998.</p><h2 id=h-honorable-mentions>Honorable Mentions</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Bret Hart vs. The Undertaker (1997)</h2><p>As with the following year, the clash between Bret Hart and The Undertaker feels like it’s right out of a video game. In hindsight, it’s a real treat to watch two all-time greats battle it out in the main event. Plus, at the time, Hart was doing some of his best character work.</p><p>Additionally, Shawn Michaels’ involvement as the special referee set up both the first Hell in a Cell bout and the match that preceded the Montreal Screwjob. It’s fair to say this contest has its rightful place in WWE history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2023/07/jeff-hardy-cm-punk-wwe-summerslam.jpg><h2>Jeff Hardy vs. CM Punk (2009)</h2><p>Jeff Hardy and CM Punk were engaged in a bitter feud that centered around a clash between Punk’s straight-edge lifestyle and Hardy’s struggle with substance abuse. The two stars waged war in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match that featured plenty of eye-opening spots. Hardy memorably hit a Swanton Bomb off a ladder. Punk scored the win, but after the bell, The Undertaker made his return to add even more juice to a fun main event.</p><p>Clearly, WWE SummerSlam has delivered plenty of amazing main events over the years, and these are just a few examples. The card is already shaping up for WWE SummerSlam 2023. With that in mind, there’s every reason to think that one of the main events could become an all-time classic. If not, it’ll be exciting to see which future headlining bouts deliver and cement their place in WWE history.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZmpraWWDen2MraapZWVixLixjKyspqWVp8CtrcxmpJqhnmKyt7HNrao%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
