Every year Forbes releases a list of the most valuable teams in the world. This is a multi-billionaire business and the value of a sports franchise depends on several factors: the team's results, sponsorships, and annual revenue&nbsp;being a few of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>10 Richest Sports Team Owners In America (And How Much They're Worth)</a></p><p>Each&nbsp;team on this list is worth billions of dollars and all they are mostly from the U.S. and Europe. Curious? Keep scrolling and discover the most valuable teams in the world, according to Forbes.</p><h2 id=new-york-giants---3-3-billion>New York Giants - $3.3 Billion</h2><p>The New York Giants&nbsp;are worth an impressive $3.3 billion, the same amount&nbsp;as last year. The team won four NFL Championships and four Super Bowls. It was created in 1925, and the Mara family bought the franchise for $500, an investment that would make them billionaires. According to Forbes, the team now belongs to John Mara and Steve Tisch.</p><p>Mara intends to do some changes&nbsp;with the team. "You don't like to see all of that talent go out the door," Mara said&nbsp;to Tom Rock of Newsday. "But let's face it, we've had one <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">winning season</a>, 2016, here and the other five or six years have not been so good since we won that last Super Bowl. So, we needed some drastic changes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=golden-state-warriors---3-5-billion>Golden State Warriors - $3.5 Billion</h2><p>The Golden State Warriors are worth $3.5 billion and&nbsp;that total increased $400 million compared to last year. The basketball team belongs to multimillionaires Joe Lacob and Peter Guber and has a $401 Million annual revenue. The Warriors have an impressive income of $2 billion that comes from season tickets, suites, and sponsorship contracts, according to Forbes.</p><p>The team has won six championships so far and is the third most valuable NBA franchise. The team has prominent stars like Draymond Green and Stephen Curry.</p><h2 id=los-angeles-lakers---3-7-billion>Los Angeles Lakers - $3.7 Billion</h2><p>According to Forbes, the average value of an NBA team is $1.9 billion. The amount represents a 13 percent increase if compared with the previous year. However, some teams can reach much higher amounts. The Los Angeles Lakers, for example, are worth $3.7 billion and&nbsp;are one of the most influential teams in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the team might fall&nbsp;a bit down&nbsp;the 2020 list. Earlier this year, Magic Johnson left his position&nbsp;as president of basketball operations and created a <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">public drama</a> with the owners. It&nbsp;has slightly tarnished the image of the team.</p><h2 id=new-england-patriots---3-8-billion>New England Patriots&nbsp;- 3.8 Billion</h2><p>The billionaire Robert Kraft paid <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$172</a> million for the New England Patriots.

Since 1994, the team has won the Super Bowl six times.</p><h2 id=manchester-united---3-8-billion>Manchester United - $3.8 Billion</h2><p>Manchester United is still one of the most valuable teams on Earth and it is worth $3.8 billion. However, it is a significant decrease if compared to the $4.12 billion it was worth <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">last year</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The British team is not doing the best at the moment. It ended in the 6th position at the Premier League and they might be out of the Champions League next year if they are found guilty of breaking financial rules. If they don't recover, there are chances the team falls down a few positions in this list next year.</p><h2 id=new-york-knicks---4-billion>New York Knicks - $4 Billion</h2><p>The New York Knicks&nbsp;are the most valuable basketball team in the world and&nbsp;are worth <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$4 billion</a>.

During an interview to ESPN, the entrepreneur revealed that someone offered $5 billion for the team, but he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't find the value appealing</a>.</p><p>"You hear numbers all the time," Dolan told ESPN. " I think people have sent feelers out, but never any that were pursued. Yeah, [the feelers are] around that number [$5 billion], but those things, it's like a stock price. It's only important if you're going to buy or sell."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=barcelona---4-02-billion>Barcelona - $4.02 Billion</h2><p>Barcelona is worth <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$4.06&nbsp;billion</a> and is one of the most valuables teams in Europe.
