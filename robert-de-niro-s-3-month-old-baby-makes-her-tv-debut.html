Chen, 45, introduced the little one to Gayle King during the Friday, July 14, episode of CBS Mornings. “She’s made it more fun,” Chen told King, 68, explaining how Gia’s arrival had changed her and De Niro’s lives.
When King jokingly asked Gia which of her dad’s movies she likes the best, Chen quipped off-camera, “The one in the delivery room, where [she’s] the star!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Oscar winner later revealed that Gia was born on April 6. In an interview with King at the time, De Niro confirmed that his new daughter’s birth <a href=#>wasn’t an accident</a>.</p><p>“I [asked him], ‘Did you want a baby?’ He goes, ‘Yes. This baby is planned,’” King explained during an episode of CBS Mornings. “They both wanted this baby, they’re over the moon. She was brought here by love, so he is very psyched and very excited about it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Robert-De-Niro-and-Tiffany-Chen-inline.png><p>During her own interview with King this week, Chen revealed that she <a href=#>suffered an unexpected complication</a> after giving birth to Gia. The trouble began when she started feeling numbness and tingling in her tongue after coming home from the hospital.</p><p>“Then I realized, like my face just felt weird. I didn’t know what the feeling was that I was having. It felt weird,” Chen explained in a clip shared on Thursday, July 13. “I was trying to eat. I went to put just a fork of food in my mouth, and everything came out. I couldn’t eat. And then I was starting to slur.”</p><p>Chen sought medical care and was diagnosed with Bell’s palsy, which is characterized by sudden weakness in the facial muscles and is often temporary. “I lost all facial function the minute I got into the hospital,” Chen recalled.</p><p>De Niro <a href=#>became a father in 1976</a> when he welcomed son Raphael, now 46, with <strong>Diahnne Abbott</strong>. He also adopted Drena, now 51, Abbott’s daughter from a previous relationship. De Niro became a dad again in 1995 when he welcomed twins Julian and Aaron, 27, with <strong>Toukie Smith</strong> via surrogate.</p><p>After exchanging vows with <strong>Grace Hightower</strong>, De Niro expanded his family with son Elliot, 25, in 1998 and daughter Helen, 11, in 2011. De Niro and Hightower, 68, called it quits in 2018 after two decades of marriage.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this month, De Niro’s grandson Leandro <a href=#>died at age 19</a>. An investigation into the teen’s death is currently ongoing, but his mother, Drena, claimed that <a href=#>his death was drug-related</a>.</p><p>On Friday, law enforcement sources told both NBC News and ABC News that a suspect — 20-year-old <strong>Sofia Haley Marks</strong> — <a href=#>had been arrested in connection</a> with Leandro’s death. According to authorities, Marks allegedly sold drugs to Leandro prior to his death. She is in police custody in New York City on federal drug distribution charges.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGarp5Kav7V5w55kp6GipHqiusNmnp9lpJ6zp63NsmScoJWjwG5%2FjKamp6yYYrytsIybmJuxXaKurLHSZp%2Beql2pw26wxJusrWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
