“I’m officially a jewelry designer. For myself,” Lively, 35, quipped via Instagram Story on Saturday, August 19. “Any iron bead jewelry requests, send ’em to me. Gonna be touch to scale this one.”
Lively used iron beads to make a large ring of rainbow-colored flowers. She tied her hair back in a sleek bun to show off her creations and adorned her hair with daisies to complement the baubles."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She’s been spending <a href=#>plenty of time in the U.K.</a> since the dual WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes meant production on her latest film, an adaptation of <a href=#><strong>Colleen Hoover</strong></a>‘s bestselling novel<a href=#> It Ends With Us</a>, had to pause.</p><p>While Reynolds (whose Deadpool sequel also is on pause) supports <a href=#>Wrexham AFC</a>, the Welsh soccer team he co-owns with<a href=#> <strong>Rob McElhenney</strong></a>, Lively has launched her own new business endeavor, Betty Booze canned cocktails. They’re an extension of her nonalcoholic <a href=#>Betty Buzz</a> mixers, which she promoted earlier this month with a steamy swimsuit snaps shared via Instagram.</p><p>She quickly received <a href=#>support from her pals</a>, including model <a href=#><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a>. “Hotty mommyyyyy,” Hadid, 28, commented.</p><p>Lively wowed in a red bikini and a yellow visor to match the yellow Meyer Lemon Betty Buzz she was drinking.</p><p>In addition to their business ventures and international jet setting, Reynolds and Lively are adjusting to life as a family of six.
