Kate Beckinsale and her daughter, Lily Mo Sheen, proved they are equally as silly as each other on Tuesday, June 4, when the Widow actress shared a hilarious text conversation they had earlier that day.
“Are you doing a lot of cocaine ?!?” Beckinsale, 45, wrote to 20-year-old Sheen in a screenshot posted on Instagram before seemingly going MIA for a bit, setting her only child off on a tirade."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

PS when the text is blue , it’s me . Right , off to sext Trevor.”</p><p>Beckinsale shares her daughter with ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Michael Sheen</strong></a>. The duo have remained on good terms since their split in 2003, and often come together for joyous occasions with their only child together, including <a href=#>doing goat yoga</a> for Beckinsale’s 45th birthday last year. The actress most recently dated comedian<a href=#><strong> Pete Davidson</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaSaeqOxwqSgp6uRobJurdKkqmackaq0qcDEq2SloZyueqqyjKyfnqtdmbyqusZmmqibkZ67pns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
