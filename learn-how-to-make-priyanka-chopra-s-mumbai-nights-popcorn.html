Rather than serving up popcorn movie theater-style with lots of butter, it is topped with a variety of spices including coriander, black pepper, garlic powder and turmeric.</p><p>The snack is perfect for cooking beginners, such as Chopra Jonas, who previously admitted to <a href=#>Us</a> that being in the kitchen is not her strong suit. “I’m a great hostess and I love having people over,” she revealed in January 2020 ahead of throwing a Super Bowl party with her husband, <strong>Nick Jonas</strong>. “[But] neither Nick or I are the best cooks.”</p><p>She went on to describe herself as “an admirer of food and a connoisseur of food,” adding, “I believe I was put on this earth to appreciate food and it’s my purpose — but I’m just not good at cooking and I don’t enjoy it!”</p><p>Cooking is a talent Chopra Jonas’ brother, <strong>Siddharth Chopra</strong>, does possess. “He actually studied and he’s a professional chef, but I just never took to it!” the Love Again star joked.</p><p>While putting together a three-course brunch in a May 2023 <a href=#>Vogue</a> video, Chopra Jonas attributed her lack of cooking knowledge to her father. “I think my dad grew up in a conservative family and saw a lot of girls having to always feel like they needed to be in the kitchen, and it was like societal pressure,” she explained. “So, he did not want me to grow up like that. So, he discouraged it. He would be like, ‘What are you doing in the kitchen? Come here.’ So, I just never learned it. Thanks, Dad.”</p><p>Despite not being a talented cook, Chopra has grown to become one of Hollywood’s biggest stars and has become a mother to daughter Malti with Jonas, 31. The couple, who wed in 2018, celebrated their little girl’s <a href=#>second birthday</a> with an adorable Elmo-themed Sesame Street party earlier this month. “Our little angel is 2 years old ❤️,” Jonas captioned photos of the birthday bash via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Tuesday, January 16.</p><p>Mumbai Nights popcorn is available in a 4-pack on <a href=# rel=noopener>eatrobs.com</a>.
