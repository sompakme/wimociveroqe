His list of credits rivals anyone from his era, and if he decided to never appear in a movie for the rest of his life, he can be sure that his legacy will never wane.

They ordered 18 cases, then requested more bottles," a source said.</p><p>This type of champagne can sell for up to $250,000 per bottle, which is a ridiculous number.
