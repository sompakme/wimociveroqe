In the pic, dancers Cheryl Burke, Witney Carson, Artem Chigvintsev, Brandon Armstrong, Daniella Karagach and Pasha Pashkov danced underneath a Mickey Mouse-shaped mirrorball.
“YESSSSSS CANT WAIT,” Carson, 28, wrote via Instagram comment at the time."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, <a href=#>the full slate of dancers has yet to be announced</a> since contracts have not been finalized,&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>can confirm.</p><p class=p3>The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>So You Think You Can Dance</a>&nbsp;</i>alum, for her part, previously<a href=#> sat out season 29 while she was pregnant</a> with son Leo. (Carson and her husband, <a href=#><strong>Carson McCallister</strong></a>, later <a href=#>welcomed their baby boy in January 2021</a>.)&nbsp;While Carson and<a href=#> <strong>Lindsay Arnold</strong></a> were both absent amid their pregnancies, many of <a href=#>their fellow&nbsp;<i>DWTS&nbsp;</i>pros hit the floor last year</a>, including Burke, <a href=#><strong>Val Chmerkovskiy</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jenna Johnson</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Sharna Burgess</strong></a>. Karagach, 29, eventually <a href=#>took home the mirrorball trophy</a> alongside NBA star <a href=#><strong>Iman Shumpert</strong></a>.</p><p class=p3>Earlier this year, Disney executives announced that <a href=#>season 31 — and next year’s season 32 —</a> will stream live on Disney+ rather than ABC. While the casting lineup had yet to be announced at the time, the pros were on board with the move.</p><p class=p3>“I actually find it very exciting,” Chigvintsev — who won&nbsp;<i>DWTS&nbsp;</i>season 29 with <a href=#><strong>Kaitlyn Bristowe</strong></a> — <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in April about the switch</a>. “What also is really exciting is we’re actually gonna be one of the first big shows … to go live on a streaming platform. So, it’s great to be part of Disney family. It’s always a good time. I think it’s very exciting.”</p><p class=p3>Johnson, for her, part was equally enthused by the change. “I’m so excited,” the 28-year-old <a href=#>pregnant reality star</a> <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in June</a>. “I think change is scary in general, but I think it also ignites a new spark and [brings] this sort of refreshing energy. … I’m just excited to see where the show goes. I think it’s amazing that we’re gonna be the first live show to be on their platform.”</p><p class=p3>While the Utah native hasn’t confirmed if she would return to the show<a href=#> amid her pregnancy</a>, she told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>that the Ukraine native, 36, was “really excited” about returning to the stage despite exit speculation.</p><p class=p3>“So, the funny thing is we actually don’t know if we’re coming back until right before the season [starts],” Johnson said at the time. “But yes, I know that Val is <a href=#>definitely excited to come back for another season</a> and I think that he’s in the best shape of his life right now. I’m not sure what happened to him [this year], but he is snatched.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3><i>DWTS&nbsp;</i>season 31 — which will be <a href=#>hosted by <strong>Tyra Banks</strong> and former champ <strong>Alfonso Ribeiro</strong></a> — premieres on Disney+ Monday, September 19, at 8:00 p.m. ET.</p><p class=p3>Scroll below to see which&nbsp;<i>DWTS&nbsp;</i>pros are returning to the competition:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BZxLW%2FjKmpqKtdlruvu9Snmp6cXZu8s3nSnpisp55igHJ51qGmrGWSlrCsecinZK2glWKvorjLq6aopV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
