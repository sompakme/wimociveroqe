A New Hampshire bill is being issued to fork over all of an individual’s digital assets (i.e. Facebook, Twitter and email accounts like Gmail) to the executor of their estate after death, as stated in legislation introduced by State Rep. Peter Sullivan. The New Hampshire House of Representatives voted 222-128 last week to give Sullivan more time to write an amendment that begins a study of the issue."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Peter Sullivan says the bill would prevent online bullying for posthumous users and provide comfort for the deceased’s loved ones. “This would give the families a sense of closure, a sense of peace. It would help prevent this form of bullying that continues even after someone dies and nobody is really harmed by it,” Sullivan said.</p><p>He recalled the story of a Canadian girl who had taken her own life because of bullying but was still taunted online after her death. “The family wasn’t able to do anything; they didn’t have access to her account.” Sullivan said in an interview with WMUR. “They couldn’t go in and delete those comments, and they couldn’t take the page down completely.”</p><p>Other states, including Oklahoma, Idaho, Rhode Island, Indiana and Connecticut, have established legislation regulating one’s digital life after death. Rhode Island and Connecticut were first to issue bills, but were only limited to e-mail accounts.</p><p>Some arguments against Sullivan’s bill say that the proposal is incomplete or is better suited for federal law.</p><p>Via: <a href=# rel=nofollow>ABC News</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6y1osCMoZipqJWjwG6ywJycm6efoHqistOeqWaclZbBqXmQbGtucWBk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
