Talk about multitasking brilliantly and double cashing in!</p><h2 id=denzel-washington><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Denzel Washington</span></h2><p>While we know some actors have veered<a href=#> more toward directing than acting,</a> Denzel still manages to do both just fine. Easily one of the greatest actors of all time with movie credits like Training Day, Malcolm X, The Pelican Brief, Washington made his directorial debut in 2002 film Antwone Fisher which he starred in. He then led and directed the 2007 film The Great Debaters. In what appears to be his biggest directorial film yet, he led and directed the critically acclaimed film adaptation Fences in 2016, where he starred alongside Viola Davis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-krasinski><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>John Krasinski</span></h2><p>The Office actor has had a good run since his days on the NBC sitcom as an actor and a director. Having made his directorial debut in 2009 comedy film Brief Interviews with Hideous Men which he also produced and wrote, he directed and starred in a lead role in box office hit A Quiet Place alongside real-life wife Emily Blunt. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Even though he hesitated about a sequel</a>, he got to direct the film's sequel A Quiet Place 2, with his killed-off character appearing only in flashbacks.</p><h2 id=joseph-gordon-levitt><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Joseph Gordon-Levitt</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor has built quite a strong acting resume for himself, having starred in 500 Days of Summer, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, and The Dark Knight Rises. With small directing credits in short films, he made his feature directorial debut in 2013 rom-com film Don Jon, where he was the leading man, alongside Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore as supporting actresses.</p><h2 id=ben-stiller><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ben Stiller</span></h2><p>The actor and comedian should be used to directing most of the comedy films he stars in. He led and directed a star-studded cast ensemble in 2008 action comedy film Tropic Thunder. Some of his leading-man and directed movies include 2013 adventure comedy-drama film The Secret Life of Walter Mitty alongside Kristen Wiig, Zoolander and its 2015 sequel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ben Stiller Directed These Shows Before The Apple TV+ Hit 'Severance'</a></span></p><h2 id=sylvester-stallone><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sylvester Stallone</span></h2><p>Sylvester Stallone is one of the most respected action stars in Hollywood, having starred in popular movies like the Rocky franchise, Rambo: First Blood, Demolition Man, and The Expendables. He led and made his directorial debut in the 1978 film Paradise Alley. Barely a year later, he reprised his titular role in Rocky II, also directing and writing. He went on to lead and direct Rocky III, Rocky IV, Rocky Balboa, Rambo, and The Expendables.</p><h2 id=tyler-perry><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Tyler Perry</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is impossible to go through this list without mentioning filmmaker Tyler Perry. The actor now turned full-time director with recent television credits like The Oval, Sistas and Zatima was one time a leading man. He portrayed Wesley Deeds III in Good Deeds alongside Thandiwe Newton, and appeared in 2014's hit film Gone Girl. He is best known for directing and playing comedic lead character Madea in several Madea feature films.

He then led and directed the 2010 film The Town. He must have enjoyed directing himself as he returned two years later as a leading man, director, and producer in the historical drama Argo. This film won him a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA for Best Director as well as a BAFTA nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role. His 2016 film Live by Night which he led and directed unfortunately flopped at the box office.</p><h2 id=halle-berry><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Halle Berry</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Halle Berry has proven time and time again that she understands the assignment when it comes to embodying iconic characters and having historic wins. Having had over 30 years acting experience, she took on a new role in the director's chair when she made her directorial debut in 2020 sports drama film Bruised which she was the leading lady, portraying Jackie "Pretty Bull" Justice.</p><h2 id=bradley-cooper><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Bradley Cooper</span></h2><p>Bradley Cooper scored himself a role of a lifetime as a famous singer in A Star Is Born, starring alongside Lady Gaga. This was monumental for the actor who got to make his directorial debut in this 2018 box office sensation, and bag a couple of awards along the way with his co-star. He is set to take on directing once again and lead <a href=#>Netflix</a>'s upcoming love story of legendary conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein and his wife Felicia Montealegre. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cooper will star as Bernstein</a> in this film titled Maestro.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Bradley Cooper 'Devastated' Lady Gaga While Filming ‘A Star Is Born’</a></span></p><h2 id=micheal-b-jordan><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Micheal B.
