What she said when she was a teenager came back to bite her, and fans have a lot of thoughts about this, considering the two women appear to be great friends now (although it has been reported that Swift is not concerned with the comments and <a href=#>has forgiven Brittany</a>). Despite what Swifties may or may not think about her, there is one person who is still her biggest fan and that is her husband, <a href=#>Patrick Mahomes</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ttweb_brittany-mahomes-friendship-with-taylor-swift-is-under-fire-after-she-s-accused-of-backstabbing-her-for-money_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Brittany Mahomes' Friendship With Taylor Swift Is Under Fire After She's Accused Of Backstabbing Her For Money</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Brittany Mahomes might have used Taylor Swift to make money and become more famous, at least according to some fans...</span><p>"People don't even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">realize how much she does</a>, taking care of the day-to-day stuff and making it so where I can focus on football, focus on my craft and everything like that," he said on Logan Paul's podcast, Impaulsive.

When you get to come home and your best friend's there, and you can just hang out, it makes you want to be there all the time. She pushes me to be great, and she's done a lot of great things herself."</p><p><strong>But fans of the couple, especially those who have kept up with them from the beginning, will not be surprised by Mahomes' latest comments about his wife</strong>. His social media (and hers, too) are filled with sweet pictures of them together, and the captions on their posts often provide a glimpse into their relationship. This includes a time when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brittany captioned a picture</a> of herself and Patrick with the message, "Thank God for giving me you." Patrick has also praised his wife publicly on multiple occasions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brittany-mahomes-and-patrick-mahomes-39-relationship-continues-to-blossom>Brittany Mahomes And Patrick Mahomes' Relationship Continues To Blossom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/brittany-mahomes-and-patrick-mahomes-1.jpg><p>Brittany Mahomes and Patrick Mahomes have one of the sweetest relationships. It started when they were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">at Whitehouse High School in Texas</a>. The couple has been dating since 2012, and their relationship is still going strong. They grew together despite attending different colleges, and in 2020, they got engaged. That same year, they also announced that Brittany was pregnant with their first child, Sterling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/patrick-mahomes-travis-kelce-superbowl.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Patrick Mahomes Teases Travis Kelce About His Age As He Returns From Vacation With Taylor Swift</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Patrick Mahomes recently joked about Travis Kelce's age, making fun of the fact that he's the oldest in the Kansas City Chiefs.</span><p><strong>On March 12, 2022, the couple celebrated another milestone with their wedding in Maui, Hawaii</strong>. Then, just two months later, they announced they would be expecting their second child. There is no denying they are incredibly in love, and Patrick has spoken with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">great affection about his wife</a>. In an earlier interview with People, he said, "I have a great wife. I think that helps out a ton. She helps me out a ton by taking stuff off my plate." He continued, "I have great people around me and I can be Patrick Mahomes. I can be myself, the same person I've grown up being — and luckily that's won a couple of Super Bowls."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinmqyinrCsecyan6illah6sb7Aoqqeq12stqexjJupoqyklru6ecyan6illah6pbHSqaCtnV2prrq4zqtkrK%2BZm8FussCnqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
