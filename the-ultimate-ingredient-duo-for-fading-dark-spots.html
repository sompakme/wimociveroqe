If you’re anything like us, you’ve probably tried facials, esthetician appointments, and every mask under the sun. Exploring skin care products can be both fun and frustrating, especially when you don’t see your desired results.</p><p>No matter what kind of skin you have — dry, oily, or combination — if you’ve been long searching for a skincare routine that delivers results and helps fade hyperpigmentation, we have a suggestion about where to look.</p><p>Hint: It’s mother nature.</p><p>All-natural ingredients have been used in skincare for centuries. As science continues to evolve, we’re finding more and more evidence that these ingredients can help you get a smooth and even skin tone, revitalize your skin’s firmness, and help address those pesky dark spots.</p><p>In this case, we’re talking about our favorite plant-derived helpers: aloe vera and turmeric. Aloe vera is a viscous extract, and turmeric is a ground spice.</p><p>Aloe vera extract is frequently advertised as an aftersun product, and turmeric shows up everywhere, from food to teas to protein powder. But what do these ingredients actually do for the skin? And how can they help you get rid of and prevent dark spots and hyperpigmentation?</p><p>Keep reading to learn more — <a href=#>or check out Gleamin’s website for a mask that can help you get the dark spot-free skin you’ve been searching for</a>.</p><p><strong>Should I DIY an Aloe Vera and Turmeric Mask?</strong></p><p>Because aloe vera and turmeric are such common household products, some people try to take things into their own hands with DIY aloe vera and turmeric masks — but these homemade “solutions” can actually do more harm than good.</p><p>It turns out that even YouTube tutorials with millions of views can lead you astray. The type of aloe vera and turmeric you use matter — some are higher quality than others, and many aren’t pure aloe or turmeric, instead being mixed with other ingredients like skin-irritating fragrance. Plus, certain types of turmeric can stain the skin, meaning that it might contribute to your pigmentation woes instead of addressing them.</p><p>Even if you manage to find the right types of aloe vera and turmeric for your skin, it’s easy for DIY formulations to become unstable. Unstable formulas can diminish in quality, functionality, and aesthetics quickly, especially if stored inappropriately.</p><p>Stability testing in professional skincare provides an added layer of protection to help ensure your mask stays helpful and safe until its clearly-stated expiration date.</p><p><strong>What Can Aloe Vera and Turmeric Do for Your Skin?</strong></p><p>Aloe vera is an impressive little plant. For such a mild substance, it’s actually quite powerful in aiding skin healing and helping to fight inflammation. Meanwhile, turmeric has a long history: It’s been used in cuisine, cosmetics, and medicine for centuries — especially in India and other parts of Southeast Asia, where it originally was grown.</p><p>So, what can these powerful ingredients actually do for your face?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-12-20-at-9.06.22-AM.png><p><strong>Helps Reduce Hyperpigmentation</strong></p><p>When these ingredients are combined together, they are a potent duo to help reduce hyperpigmentation. Turmeric actually inhibits the production of melanin which is responsible for all forms of hyperpigmentation. Meanwhile, aloe vera’s aloin and aloesin chemicals reduce hyperpigmentation by destroying existing melanin cells while preventing new melanin formation.</p><p>Blemishes like sun spots, dark spots, and red patches are no match for these two ingredients combined.</p><p><strong>Helps Brighten the Skin</strong></p><p>Turmeric works as a natural lightening agent for the skin thanks to curcumin — the same antioxidant that helps inhibit melanin production.</p><p>Antioxidants are compounds that inhibit oxidation, a process that is triggered by the presence of something called free radicals. Free radicals come from a variety of sources, including pollution, smog, the sun’s rays, and dust.</p><p>When free radicals overpower our body and create oxidative stress, they begin to break down our skin’s collagen, contributing to premature wrinkles, sun spots, and dark spots.</p><p>Turmeric’s natural antioxidant compounds fight back, restoring your skin’s collagen. They’re pretty hardcore.</p><p>At the same time, aloe vera’s aloin brightens as it reduces hyperpigmentation, providing a double dose of skin rejuvenation.</p><p><strong>Helps Hydrate the Skin</strong></p><p>Ensuring that our skin is getting enough hydration is difficult. As the outermost part of our body, it’s extremely exposed to all sorts of damage. Aloe vera and turmeric help hydrate the skin to restore its protective barrier and ensure it can retain water.</p><p>The result? Glowing, hydrated skin that looks like it’s being lit from the inside out.</p><p><strong>Get the Even Tone You’ve Been Searching for With Gleamin</strong></p><p>If you’re not already sold on what turmeric and aloe vera can do for hyperpigmentation and dark spots, allow us to blow your mind with some before and after images.
