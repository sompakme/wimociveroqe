They had racks of one after another of incredibly outrageous showgirl costumes and I got to try them all on. The funny thing was that the headpieces were so tall in this costume room that I had to kneel down to try them all on. I didn’t get to look at myself in a mirror standing up in that costume which is funny, so I look forward to seeing the show to finally see how I look.</p><p>On how many people it took to get the head piece on:</p><p>The big part of it was actually sitting on my shoulders. It was a giant fan that had a brace over my shoulders. It took a few people to help get me into it. It was just so heavy and unwieldy because it was so big.</p><p>On her feelings after walking onto the stage with the costume on:</p><p>The people that were hired to be the crowd other than the core cast, everyone in the audience at this club was not told that I was there or anything about the scene. It was really fun and I was really looking forward to the girls seeing me in that costume and it was amazing. I loved that surprise element and that they were able to catch a real reaction on film.</p><p>Read the complete interview <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZBrbHFuaWK0prHNmmSdmaaewG6y0aikZp%2BcpMRuwMCloqxlo5qutLvNZmpmm5%2Bowba5xGaaoZmenLI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
