And never signed w nobody else.” While Bow Wow dropped his first two albums on Jermaine Dupri’s So So Def imprint, the rapper was discovered initially by Snoop Dogg at a concert in 1993. Snoop gave Bow the “Lil Bow Wow” moniker and introduced the young rapper to the world on “Gz and Hustlas” from Snoop’s classic debut album&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Doggystyle</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>When fans caught the subliminal shade at Jermaine Dupri, fans wanted to know more.&nbsp;</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Stayed w Snoop.

I aint work with that boy in years. He do him and i do me.” When pressed more about it, he said he’s “cool” if he never works with the Atlanta producer again, but there’s no beef between the two. “Jd cool. We just don’t work together that’s all. Me n jd aint worked together in like 10 years. I gotta work with the man to be cool?”</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Not really.

Yall think I’m playing, but I’m dead forreal.” When fans started naming their favorite Bow Wow albums, he shot them all down. “Wanted album mid to me. This is my opinion tho. All my albums mid. Just saying. Just because I did them dont mean I like em.”&nbsp;</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dont care for any of my albums.<br>Dont have a fav song.
