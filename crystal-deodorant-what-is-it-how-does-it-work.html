The natural deodorant began to surface in the United States back in the 1980's,&nbsp;but it has recently gained popularity as people move to a more natural, organic lifestyle.</p><p>Here is how the crystal deodorant works. The mineral salts in crystal deodorant prevent the growth of odor-causing bacteria when the minerals get wet and are applied to dry skin. Now that you know exactly how it works, the real question is, does it prevent you from being sweaty and smelly?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The truth is, there is no scientific proof that crystal deodorant works better than regular deodorant or antiperspirant. In fact, there is no evidence that it will stop you from sweating.&nbsp;So, why are people becoming so obsessed with the new type of deodorant? One benefit of crystal deodorant is that it does an excellent job of eliminating nasty body odors. Some people have even said they sweat less once switching to the form of deodorant because the mineral salts make their underarms drier.</p><p>Despite the new craze, there is no harm in sticking with your current antiperspirant or <a href=#>deodorant</a>. If you go unscented, you are using fewer chemicals, but also there is no proof these two items cause cancer or other diseases. The flipside is there is nothing wrong with trying crystal deodorant. It takes people a while to get used to the wetness, but once that is done then, the minerals will help with the odor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It all comes down to personal preference. Hopefully, the ultimate goal is not to be smelly and sweaty, so whatever helps achieve that is good to go.</p><p><strong>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>CALIFORNIA BECOMES THE FIRST STATE TO BAN COSMETIC TESTING ON ANIMALS</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmiboq7Ata3LZpuep5Skv6K602aYp6yZpbKzv8%2BiqZqmpGKyubzLmqCnnZRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
