As <a href=#><strong>Ryan Seacrest</strong></a> explained, the celebratory dessert was bread-shaped because of Ripa’s love of “bread club,” which involves the hosts trying loaves from across the country.</p><p>“We had our friend Buddy Valastro make a special bread loaf cake for Kelly’s birthday,” the American Idol host explained as the cake was wheeled onto the stage. “The loaves have arrived.”</p><p>Though Ripa was likely expecting a cake during the show, she was still caught off guard by her special confection. “We were so mesmerized by the cake, I didn’t realize Mark was wheeling the cake out,” she exclaimed before giving her husband, <a href=#><strong>Mark Consuelos</strong></a>, a hug.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Later, the talk show host thanked her friends and family for the cakes, <a href=# data-gift=1>gifts</a> and birthday wishes. “I will never be able to properly express my gratitude to everyone (especially @instasuelos and @ryanseacrest) for all the fabulous birthday wishes and love, so I’ll just simply say thank you all for making me feel so good!” she gushed on Instagram, adding “#halfwayto99.”</p><p>Scroll down to see more of Ripa’s sweet birthday treats.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyxtcKtrKudo2S4prjLsmSroaCWeqSxy56Zq5mkmrFutMSrZJuhoqm1pa3YZq6irJhiura406KnpZ1dmK6ssdJmp6GnpKTAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
