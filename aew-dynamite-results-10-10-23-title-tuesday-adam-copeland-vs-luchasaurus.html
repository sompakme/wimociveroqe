MJF goes off and says he’s trying to be better. Meanwhile, Jay uses people, including BC Gold. MJF would know because that’s out of his playbook. But for the first time, he has earned the fans’ respect. MJF only cares about Cole and the Triple B. White says MJF can’t just ask for the title — he has to win it at Full Gear. But if MJF can’t wait, he can try and take it with four of them vs. one. White challenges MJF to find three partners.

Saraya hits a second Knight Cap, but Shida kicks out again. Shida hits Saraya with Falcon Arrow. They trade covers until Shida stacks on top for the three.</p><p>Renee tries speaking to MJF, but he’s not in the mood. Instead, he calls Adam who is still at Roddy’s. Adam loses connection before The Acclaimed walks up and offers to team with MJF. Caster’s proposal doesn’t go well as MJF walks off. Billy questions Caster’s infatuation with MJF.</p><p>Christian Cage accompanies Luchasaurus out for the main event.

Adam goes for a spear but Luchasaurus catches him with a chokeslam for another nearfall. Both men boot each other down. Adam chops Lucha and goes to bump him onto the stairs, but Lucha chokes him instead. On the apron, Adam counters and slams Lucha onto his back.
