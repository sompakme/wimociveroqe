In a legal dispute that began earlier this year, Astley took legal action against Yung Gravy the rapper over his 2022 single "Betty (Get Money)."</p><p>This song used elements from Astley's 1987 single "Never Gonna Give You Up" without proper permission. While Gravy reportedly secured the rights to use “underlying musical composition” from the song, what he didn’t have was authorization to use Astley’s voice, leading to the legal conflict.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kanye-West-Sued-By-Employee-Claiming-Unsafe-Working-Conditions-In-His-Bomb-Shelter-House.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kanye West's Legal Issues Continue Mounting As Another Ex-Employee Files A Lawsuit</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The ex-staffer says Ye wouldn't provide him with sleeping arrangements during the employment nightmare.</span><p>"The public could not tell the difference. The imitation of Mr. Astley's voice was so successful the public believed it was actually Mr. Astley singing," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">court documents from Astley’s team said</a>, alleging the musician’s belief that his real voice was sampled in Yung Gravy’s hit. "In an effort to capitalize off of the immense popularity and goodwill of Mr. Astley."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"A license to use the original underlying musical composition does not authorize the stealing of the artist's voice in the original recording," the lawsuit went on. "So, instead, they resorted to theft of Mr. Astley's voice without a license and without agreement."</p><p>Rather than going to court, the legal teams for the two musicians were recently able to reach a settlement to rest the case. The exact figure hasn’t been released, but considering Gravy possibly made millions in profits from his single, Astley may have easily negotiated a six-figure sum or more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some copyright infringement cases involving hit songs have resulted in million-dollar payouts. For example, in 2015, a jury determined the hit song "Blurred Lines" by Robin Thicke, Pharrell, and T.I. infringed upon Marvin Gaye's song "Got to Give It Up." As a result, the jury <a href=#>awarded the Gaye family $7.4 million in damages</a>.</p><p>“While we respect the judicial process, we are extremely disappointed in the ruling made today, which sets a horrible precedent for music and creativity going forward.,” Thicke, Pharrell, and T.I. said in a statement following the ruling.</p><p>“Blurred Lines was created from the heart and minds of Pharrell, Robin and T.I. and not taken from anyone or anywhere else,” it continued. “We are reviewing the decision, considering our options and you will hear more from us soon about this matter.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, Astley’s lawsuit was initiated by Richard Busch, the lawyer who successfully represented the winning side in the copyright dispute involving "Blurred Lines."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsq2enHqovsCvsGarlanBrbHSZqOar6OqtrV50aKapGWRqMGtsdhmraibkaF6qrnPnqmsp56Wwaq7zWaapZmZosBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
