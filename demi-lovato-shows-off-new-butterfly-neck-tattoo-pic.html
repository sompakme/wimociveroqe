The 28-year old unveiled the new ink on Wednesday, September 2, via an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a> — and fans are anxious to learn more about the design.</p><p>In the selfie, the Disney Channel alum poses in a cleavage-baring floral dress designed by Alexandre Vauthier Official, an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elise Paige Jewels necklace</a> and pink pointy Casadei pumps. She tilts her head to one side to snap the pic, showing off the large butterfly tattoo on the right side of her neck.</p><p>The hitmaker captioned the stunning snap, “Dear little me, I’m sorry that it took so long but baby your free..🥰☺️💖.” Fans are speculating that these are new song lyrics, but others are more focused on the new ink.</p><p>“THAT BUTTERFLY TATTOO THOUGH,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one fan</a> tweeted and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another wrote</a>, “Girl is that a butterfly tattoo I see? That looks gorgeous as f–k!”</p><p>The “Anyone” singer has an impressive tattoo collection that’s complete with over 25 different designs. She already has two other neck designs, including the word “survivor” and an elaborate “divine feminine’ tattoo, both of which she unveiled in December 2019.</p><p>Both of those neck designs are symbolic of Lovato’s journey to recovery. The “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Survivor” ink</a>, brought to life by celeb-inker Dr. Woo, represents how far she’s come in her sobriety journey following her near-fatal overdose in 2018.</p><p>And the intricately designed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“divine feminine” tattoo</a> was the work of Rome-based tattoo artist Alessandro Capozzi. The star posted a black-and-white photo of design with a lengthy caption detailing its significance.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I told him [Capozzi] about my life and where I was at in that moment and we created a combination of images that best symbolized the spiritual awakening I was having,” wrote Lovato. “Having a fallen angel being lifted by 3, pure, angelic doves (the Holy trinity) as her inner light is being guided by a higher consciousness, and the disintegration of her dark wings was representing the darkness I was shedding.”</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5myrrWMpaavmaSkerS0zrCqZqeWm3qvsdZmma6spJq%2Fp7jYZqWem5tiwaLA06imZqiZmHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
