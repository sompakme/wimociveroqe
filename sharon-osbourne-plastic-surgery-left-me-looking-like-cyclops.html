[To the surgeon] I’m, like, ‘You’ve got to be f–king joking.’ One eye was different to the other. I looked like a f–king Cyclops. I’m, like, ‘All I need is a hunchback.’”</p><p>She added that <a href=#><strong>Ozzy Osbourne</strong></a>, who she married in 1982, confirmed it didn’t look good. “He said, ‘I don’t care how much it costs, we’ll get it redone,’” she recalled.</p><p>However, Sharon — who shares children <a href=#><strong>Aimee</strong></a>, 38, <a href=#><strong>Kelly</strong></a>, 37, and <a href=#><strong>Jack</strong></a>, 36, with Ozzy — said her face is “settling now,” and she likes her new look.</p><p>This wasn’t the first time the Osbournes alum had trouble after going under the knife. She revealed an unexpected side effect from a face lift during an October 2019 appearance on <a href=#>The Kelly Clarkson Show</a>.</p><p>“I had this thing where they lifted up my mouth and then for the first week I couldn’t feel my mouth, I <a href=#>can hardly feel my mouth</a> now, to be honest with you,” Osbourne explained at the time. “I couldn’t find my mouth. It was numb and it was up on one side and I looked like <a href=#>Elvis</a>. All the kids and Ozzy are going, ‘Why are you snarling at me?’ And I’m like, ‘I’m not snarling; I’m not doing anything!’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Worrying about the results has even had the England native <a href=#>temporarily swear off plastic surgery</a>. In 2012, the TV host, who will join the U.K.’s new TalkTV channel later this month, claimed she’d stop getting cosmetic procedures.</p><p>“I have been looking at pictures of myself recently since I started to lose weight,” she said at the time. “And in a lot of shots, my face looks plastic and at certain angles I was like, ‘Oh, dear. Oh, I should never have done that. Oh, that’s a bad one.’ So I’m like, ‘No more. No more abuse.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoJGnvK95zqyZqK2io7JuvMuaqq2hk2LAtr7GnqmyZZyas7V5zJ5kpaefoLavs4yloKSdXZjGpLjOqapo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
