Tiger Woods’ 11-year-old son, Charlie, is following in his father’s footsteps.
The preteen competed at Hammock Creek Golf Club in Palm City, Florida, earlier this month. Charlie played in a U.S. Kids Golf-sanctioned event and rose to the top of the leaderboard in the boys’ 11-year-old division.
The little one shot three-under 33 across nine holes, finishing with three birdies and zero bogeys, according to U.S. Kids Golf’s stats.
When Charlie competed at a junior golf event in South Florida in January, Woods, 44, caddied for his son."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>
