Everything The Former NWA Rapper Has Been Up To Since His Last Album</a></span></p><p>But what makes the most impactful rap group special? Is it the chemistry? Personalities of each member? Originality? Cultural impact? Lyrics? For whatever ingredient that is, the most successful rap groups all have one thing in common: their solid body work has cemented them as some of the best-selling musical groups of all time. From Cypress Hill to the Black Eyed Peas, here are some of the most successful rap troupes of all time based on their album sales.</p><h2 id=n-w-a><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>N.W.A.</span></h2><p>Members: DJ Yella, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, MC Ren</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eazy-E and his Ruthless Records imprint birthed N.W.A. at an extremely chaotic time in America, but these Compton boys were relentless and never afraid to speak their truths. Consisted of longtime friends, they glued easily over music that they love and the reality they faced. Their most infamous hit, "F the Police," was, and still is, an anti-police brutality anthem all over the world. Until their split in 1991, the group has sold over 10 million units in the US alone despite the major backlash and radio ban.</p><h2 id=salt-n-pepa><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Salt-N-Pepa</span></h2><p>Members: Cheryl James, Sandra Denton</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the height of misogynistic views in rap music of the 1980s and the 1990s, Salt-N-Pepa broke the barrier and became one of the first all-female groups that actually took the scene by storm. Their contribution brought a fresh breath to the male-dominated genre, and they paved the way for future women artists to thrive, selling over 15 million units worldwide until their fall from grace in 2002.</p><h2 id=cypress-hill><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Cypress Hill</span></h2><p>Members: B-Real, Sen Dog, Eric Bobo, DJ Muggs, Mellow Man</p><p>Cypress Hill is what happens when an elite DJ meets street wisdom: DJ Muggs and B-Real got real on the mic, and they were the anthem of every stoner back in the 1990s. The Latin hip-hop troupe took the world by storm with their three consecutive platinum albums, and their legacy will forever be cherished.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To Beastie Boys?</a></span></p><h2 id=outkast><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>OutKast</span></h2><p>Members: André 3000, Big Boi</p><p>Inspired by the psychedelic funk and acid rock of the Parliament collective, OutKast helped put Southern hip-hop on the map. The duo, which was composed of two longtime friends André 3000 and Big Boi, totaled over 20 million record sales between their six studio albums, including the classics Aquemini and Stankonia.</p><h2 id=beastie-boys><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Beastie Boys</span></h2><p>Members: John Berry, Mike D, Kate Schellenbach, MCA, Ad-Rock</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nobody ever expected three white kids to glue together and form one of the most genre-bending and influential rap groups of all time, but here we are with Beastie Boys. The troupe combined ill truth lyrics and hard-hitting rock, giving a fresh breath into the scene of hip-hop at the time and inventing a new sound that influenced a lot of great rap acts, including <strong><a href=#>Eminem</a></strong>. Together, they sold over 20 million copies in the US alone for their seven platinum-certified albums.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Fergie Still Friends With The Black Eyed Peas?</a></span></p><h2 id=fugees><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Fugees</span></h2><p>Members: Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean, and Pras Michel</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite their ill-fated breakup drama after releasing only two albums together, Fugees cemented their legacy forever. The talented bunch started their journey back in the early 1990s, but it was enough to make them among the best-selling rap groups of all time with over 22 million record sales.</p><h2 id=black-eyed-peas><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Black Eyed Peas</span></h2><p>Members: will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Taboo, J. Rey Soul, Fergie, Kim Hill</p><p>Originally starting their career as an alternative/conscience hip-hop group, the Black Eyed Peas rebranded themselves as a marketable pop/dance-rap crew shortly after Fergie's arrival. It wasn't until 2003 when they released their third album, Elephunk, that they started dominating charts everywhere they go. With over 80 million record sales, there's no doubting their influence on the musical landscape.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Remaining a fan and studying new genres that we’re inspired by, collaborating with different artists, and utilizing the pandemic as an outlet to create and express.” said Taboo in an exclusive interview with HollywoodLife, reflecting on the group's 25th anniversary. He added, “I think being students of music and making sure we understand it as a competitive field helps…but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">we’re always down to contribute to the music world</a> and really help culture exchange."</p><h2 id=run-dmc><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Run-DMC</span></h2><p>Members: Joseph "Run" Simmons, Darryl "D.M.C."

So much so that they're often hailed as one of the genre's most influential acts of all time and pioneered the birth of the new school. They were the first in everything, from having their video broadcast on MTV to being the cover star of Rolling Stone Magazine. They <a href=#>claimed</a> to have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sold over 230 million records worldwide</a> throughout their decades-lasting career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuwMeeZKano6l6tMHCnJysq5aquW6%2BwKlkoKqfqr1uu8VmmKWkXam2rrGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
