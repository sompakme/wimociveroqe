Their love story proves that young love is absolutely possible, and they both seem excited to officially commit to each other.

She posted song lyrics from the Taylor Swift song "Lover" in the Instagram post. This was relatable since it proves that Brown is a Swift fan just like everyone else. It's clear that the couple has something special and that they are really happy to be in such a good place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/millie-bobby-brown-jake-bongivoi.jpg><p>Several <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stranger Things actors were happy that Brown got engaged</a>. It doesn't seem that she got any negative feedback from her castmates at all. This definitely suggests that the cast gets along, which is what fans have always thought.</p><p>E! News reported that when Brown shared the news on Instagram, Cara Buono, who plays Karen Wheeler, wrote, "Beautiful! So happy for you!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Millie Bobby Brown Has Been A Magnet For Scandal, Here's The Truth About Her Most Shocking Controversies</a></span></p><p>Jamie Campbell Bower posted heart emojis, which is adorable. But it was Millie Bobby Brown's Stranger Things co-star Noah Schnapp who had the best response. He commented, "OH MY GOD CONGRATS."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2C5807D3-5190-46DA-9538-FCAEAD4C80BC.jpeg><p>It makes sense that Schnapp would be so thrilled for Brown because the two are close friends. In fact, according to The Daily Mail, Brown once said that she wanted him to be Maid of Honor if she ever got married.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The publication reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Schnapp and Brown chatted about Brown's future wedding</a> in an Instagram Live. Schnapp said, 'If you have a kid I want to be the godfather" and Brown said, "100 per cent you're the godfather to my kids. And the maid of honour to my wedding." Brown added that her now fiance would be happy with that: "He probably would choose you, he probably would. I'd have to really convince him you'd be such a great best man."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Did Millie Bobby Brown Learn Her American Accent?</a></span></p><p>Noah Schnapp definitely seems to like Millie Bobby Brown's fiance Jake Bongiovi. They even all hang out together. In June 2023, The Daily Mail reported that the couple was having dinner with Brown's mom and dad Kelly and Robert Brown, and Schnapp was there, too.</p><p>When Brown was interviewed on The Drew Barrymore Show, she told the actress that her now fiance wondered if something was going on between her and Schnapp. She explained, "Jake, who is my boyfriend, when we first met he was like, 'You guys are in love.' But it's in the most platonic way."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Millie Bobby Brown's other Stranger Things co-stars don't seem to have commented on her fiance. It's possible that the topic hasn't come up in interviews. There's also the fact that over the past few months, actors haven't been giving interviews because of the SAG-AFTRA strike. Brown's co-stars are big fans of her, though. According to People, David Harbour said on a podcast called That Scene with Dan Patrick in 2021, "Millie and I have always had sort of a special relationship because I knew her when she was so young. I knew her before any of this big fame hit. "I have a real protective feeling for her. I have a real, like, worry,"</p><p>In August 2023, Millie Bobby Brown was interviewed by Women's Wear Daily and talked about her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">upcoming wedding to Jake Bongiovi</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/5-10.png><p>The actress explained that she didn't want to talk that much about it, which makes sense since she has become so famous over the last few years. She said, “I think probably drawing the curtains, just because there are only so many moments in life that you get only once. And to have everyone’s opinions and eyes looking at that just feels unnatural to me. So I feel it’s important to keep those things, those small precious moments in life, really close to your chest. I can say that the planning is going — it’s so fun and it’s such an exciting time in my life.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=do-millie-bobby-brown-39-s-family-and-friends-like-her-fiance-jake-bongiovi>Do Millie Bobby Brown's Family And Friends Like Her Fiance Jake Bongiovi?</h2><p>It sounds like everyone in Millie Bobby Brown's life is a big fan of Jake Bongiovi.
