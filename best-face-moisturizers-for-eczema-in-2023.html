During active flare-ups, you might choose to use a targeted soothing moisturizer more frequently to help calm symptoms and improve skin comfort.</p><h3>Should you patch test if you have eczema-prone skin?</h3><p>Yes, you should always patch test before adding a new skincare or grooming product to your routine. Take a small amount of the product and apply it inside your elbow to clean, dry skin. Leave that area alone for at least 24 hours, and avoid washing it (unless you experience any intense negative side effects, in which case you should wash off the product immediately and cease use). If you notice any signs of irritation (such as itchiness, skin flaking, persistent redness, a rash or breakouts), the product likely isn’t a good fit for your needs.</p><h3>What ingredients should you avoid if you have eczema-prone skin?</h3><p>There are some ingredients that anyone with eczema should avoid in their moisturizers and other grooming products. They include synthetic fragrances, alcohols, sulfates, parabens, phthalates and artificial colors. Everyone’s skin is different and will react differently to certain ingredients, but all of the above-mentioned ingredients have the potential to irritate and dry out the skin, and may trigger eczema flare-ups.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Not done shopping?
