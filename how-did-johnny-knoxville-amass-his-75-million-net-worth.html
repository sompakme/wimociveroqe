The series was not afraid to push the envelope and become one of the most infamous shows in history, and Johnny Knoxville became a massive star while on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, Knoxville would undergo a number of twists and turns in his career, and it led to him having a massive net worth. It’s been a long road, but at the end of the day, it has completely been worth it for the star, broken bones and all.</p><p>So, how did Knoxville make so much money? Let’s dive in and see!</p><h2 id=jackass-hits-it-big>Jackass Hits It Big</h2><p>One of the most obvious ways that Johnny Knoxville has been able to make his incredible fortune over the years was by way of Jackass becoming such a success on the small screen.</p><p>People that are old enough to remember Jackass making it’s debut back in 2000 no doubt remember the fact that the show was a sensation and quickly took over the small screen. This was the series that took pranking&nbsp;and crazy stunts to an entirely different level, and given the fact that it was available on MTV, the show was going to be open to&nbsp;a large audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only was Johnny Knoxville one of the biggest stars to emerge from the show, but he is someone that actually helped create the series itself, meaning that he was able to laugh all the way to the bank as the show continued to spike in popularity.</p><p>Jackass was an incredibly popular show, and the films that emerged from this series also went on to be a nice way for Knoxville to take home some bank. In total, there have been three Jackass films to hit the big screen, and Johnny Knoxville not only starred in them, but he also got some producer and writer credits, according to&nbsp;IMDb.</p><p>As great as Jackass was for Knoxville to make it big and to make some bank, he would also go on to have a lucrative career as a legitimate film actor.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bam Margera Used To Have A $45 Million Net Worth, Here’s What He Has Left Today</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-had-a-lucrative-acting-career>He Had A Lucrative Acting Career</h2><p>One of the great things about making it big on the small screen is that it opens up doors for the big screen, and Johnny Knoxville was more than happy to jump at the opportunity to turn into a viable movie star during the 2000s.</p><p>Even though the Jackass franchise was still rolling along with the release of theatrical films, Johnny Knoxville was also able to land lead roles in comedic projects that helped him reach a&nbsp;wider audience.</p><p>According to IMDb, Johnny Knoxville would appear in films like Men in Black II, The Ringer, Walking Tall, and The Dukes of Hazzard, all of which did wonders in helping him gain some new fans while also maintaining the fan base that he achieved with Jackass. The box office receipts&nbsp;weren’t always massive, but Knoxville’s newfound big screen fame was cool to see for fans.</p><p>In the 2010s, films like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Bad Grandpa&nbsp;helped Johnny Knoxville stay on top during a new decade, meaning that his career had a sizable amount of longevity to it. His television days may be his bread and butter, but his work in film is nothing to scoff at.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coincidentally, Knoxville has also done some work behind the camera, as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What ‘Jackass’ Star Steve-O Did To Promote His New Comedy Special Will Make You Want To Watch</a></span></p><h2 id=knoxville-the-producer>Knoxville, The Producer</h2><p>A lot of people that don’t appear in front of the camera end up making a lot of money in the world of film, and Johnny Knoxville has a number of producer credits to his name, meaning that he has been able to cash in behind the scenes.</p><p>Not only has Johnny Knoxville gotten producing credits for the Jackass films, but he also received some credits for his work in the film Bad Grandpa and his most recent release Action Point, according to&nbsp;IMDb. These also happened to be movies that he starred in, meaning that his salary was a bit higher than normal thanks to the producing&nbsp;credits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly, Knoxville didn’t just produce things that he appeared in. The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia and The Birth of Big Air are two projects that Johnny Knoxville had a hand <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in producing</a>, despite not being a lead in either. Some might not expect Johnny Knoxville to get his hands dirty in the documentary game, but this just goes to show that he is always willing to make something that he believes in.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Are ‘Jackass’ Star Steve-O And Gordon Ramsay?</a></span></p><p>$75 million is a staggering net worth, and if&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jackass 4</a> is a&nbsp;monster&nbsp;hit, then expect this number to keep growing.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is The ‘Jackass’ Cast Cursed?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecmon6emqWK4r7vXr6ClpJVirq6t0qxkoaGjYoR2ecyio6Whn6N6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
