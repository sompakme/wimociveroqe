This morning four more matches were announced for that weekend.</p><p>On night one, <a href=#>Fred Yehi</a> will face <a href=#>“Switch Blade” Jay White</a> of The Bullet Club, and Juice Robinson of FinJuice will take on El Phantasmo.</p><p>Then on night two, Ring of Honor’s Jonathan Gresham will challenge Alex Coughlin and a massive ten-man tag that features&nbsp;Team Filthy going up against the team of Ren Narita, Karl Fredericks, Fred Rosser, Rocky Romero, and the DKC.</p><p>The following comings from <a href=#>New Japan Pro Wrestling</a> regarding the four newly announced matches for New Japan Showdown on October 16 and 17 in Philadelphia:</p><p>BULLET CLUB will be well represented at Showdown, with El Phantasmo and Jay White both in singles action on night one. Phantasmo will do battle with Juice Robinson; after Robinson’s wars with Hikuleo of late, his issues with the Club are not over, and ELP will seek to drop Juice and introduce the 2300 Arena to Sudden Death.</p><p>Also set for night one in Philly, Jay White will do battle with Fred Yehi. This week on NJPW STRONG, the Switchblade will go one on one with Wheeler Yuta in non title action. How will Yuta’s Savageweight tag team partner fare against the NEVER Openweight Champion?</p><p>Having continued with Tomohiro Ishii on Fighting Spirit Unleashed, Alex Coughlin’s Open Challenge Series sees yet another major encounter as he takes on ROH’s ‘Octopus’ Jonathan Gresham. The former ROH Pure Champion makes his return to NJPW competition at Showdown, and will test and stretch Coughlin in more ways than one as the LA Dojo member looks for a defining performance to lead to his official graduation.</p><p>Also on night two, Team Filthy will put in a united front for the first time since Resurgence, all five members teaming together as they face the combination of Ren Narita, Karl Fredericks, Fred Rosser, Rocky Romero and the DKC. With Narita and Rosser fighting out their own issues this week on STRONG, will this five man team function well enough to take on the Fight Dream that is Team Filthy?</p><p>&nbsp;<a href=#>Wheeler Yuta vs. Jay White Announced For 9/25 NJPW STRONG, Updated Card</a></p><p>Are you excited about New Japan Showdown in Philadelphia?
