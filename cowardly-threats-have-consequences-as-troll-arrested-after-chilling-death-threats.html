It’s believed that the arrest is the result of a 6-month police investigation, sparked by complaints from Morgan, who is thought to have endured a steady torrent of abusive messages from the troll for about a year.    It’s likely that the anonymous abuser was detained for violating the Malicious Communications Act, a British law defined by top solicitors’ firm JMW as targeting:  “Any person who sends a letter, electronic communication or article of any description to another person which conveys… a message that is indecent or grossly offensive… a threat… information that is false and is known or believed to be false by the sender."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Calling the police, big tech or beefing up your security isn’t going to stop us getting to you, this isn’t a threat piers, it’s a promise. Your (sic) getting killed.”</p><p>A similarly disturbing message was then sent to Morgan’s sports journalist son Spencer, saying “If you don’t get your dad, your [sic] getting it or your mum.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>A Complete Timeline Of Meghan Markle And Piers Morgan’s Feud</a></span></p><h2 id=piers-revealed-that-he-was-particularly-rattled-by-the-troll-targeting-his-family>Piers Revealed That He Was Particularly Rattled By The Troll Targeting His Family</h2><p>Addressing the alleged arrest last night, Piers appeared relieved, attesting “<a href=#>People think it’s perfectly OK to make death threats to public figures on social media</a>, but it’s not — there has to be a line drawn, especially when family members are targeted.”</p><p>“That’s why I reported it and I am grateful to the Met Police and Greater Manchester Police for taking it so seriously.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A confidant of the presenter later added “This is a point of principle for Piers — he will not tolerate evil threats being sent to his loved ones.”</p><p>“A troll sent an unbelievably vile and graphic message to both Piers and Spencer, pledging to kill. An arrest has finally been made, but the lengthy investigation is still ongoing.”</p><p>“Piers hopes this evil troll ends up in prison where he belongs. Hopefully it’ll also act as a deterrent to other online abusers.”</p><p>As of the time of writing, it is thought that the culprit has been released on bail and that the decision on whether they are to be charged will be determined shortly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Nikki Minaj And Piers Morgan's Awkward Twitter Feud: A Rundown</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinop2iqHquu9GgmKdlpKe8rbiMmqmrnaOpsqV5wqGgpaSZo7RusMSaq6FlpJ2%2Fpq3TrGSsp55iwLGxzZycq2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
