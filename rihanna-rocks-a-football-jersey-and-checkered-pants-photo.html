The lovebirds, who welcomed their first child together — a baby boy — in May, were spotted grabbing dinner in New York on Tuesday, August 23, in coordinated looks. For her part, Rihanna, 34, managed to make a busy outfit look chic.

On her feet, the Barbados native sported clogs by Gucci x Adidas. Rihanna topped the outfit off with white sunglasses and had her hair styled in shaggy waves.</p><p>Debunking fashion myths is a habit for the “Needed Me” musician. She often <a href=#>pushes the envelope</a> with bold outfits that include contrasting colors and textures. She also makes statements with her mane and glam, rocking vibrant lip colors and different hairstyles.</p><p>Rocky, 33, also breaks fashion barriers. The “Purple Swag” rapper matched Rihanna for their late-night outing, rocking Gucci logo-print trousers and a crisp white T-shirt. He finalized his look with a gold chain necklace, a black baseball cap and blue and white sneakers.</p><p>The couple’s outing comes after Rocky <a href=#>pleaded not guilty</a> to two counts of assault with a firearm over a November 2021 incident in Los Angeles. Rocky appeared in court on August 17, and the judge issued a restraining order stating the rapper must stay 100 yards away from the victim. The New York Native has been accused of shooting his friend last year. A preliminary trial is set for November 2, 2022.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Us Weekly first reported that Rihanna and Rocky were “hooking up” in February 2020 and he <a href=#>confirmed the romance</a> in May of that year.</p><p>“[It’s] so much better when you got The One. She amounts to probably, like, a million of the other ones,” Rocky told <a href=#>GQ</a> at the time, describing Rihanna as “the love of my life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6e2qa3Np5hmqp%2BYuLR5wGadqKekl66tuIyjnKurla56orrDZpqhnZOgsrOxw2anmqakqHqxtM6tpmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
