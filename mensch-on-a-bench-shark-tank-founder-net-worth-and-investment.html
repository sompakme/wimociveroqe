As a Jewish family, they wanted a similar toy that would incorporate their own traditions, so Hoffman created the concept of a Mensch on a Bench. This led to a successful Kickstarter campaign and the development of the plush toy and accompanying book.</p><h3>Mensch on a Bench: Recreating Tradition</h3><p>One day, while shopping with his son, Neal Hoffman noticed his son’s fascination with the Elf on the Shelf, a popular Christmas toy that brings holiday magic to children’s lives. As a Jewish family, they wanted a toy that would connect them to their own traditions during the holiday season – and thus, the idea for Mensch on a Bench was born.</p><p>Inspired to create a <b>Jewish alternative to Elf on the Shelf</b>, Hoffman envisioned a plush toy that would embody the values and spirit of the Hanukkah season. A Mensch, meaning a person of integrity and honor in Yiddish, was the perfect character to represent the essence of Jewish tradition and values.</p><p>To bring his vision to life, Hoffman launched a successful Kickstarter campaign, generating support and funding from fellow individuals who also sought a Jewish alternative to the popular Christmas toy. The funds raised allowed Hoffman to develop the Mensch on a Bench plush toy and create an accompanying book, which tells the story of Moshe the Mensch and his role in spreading Hanukkah joy.</p><p>The concept of Mensch on a Bench quickly gained attention and resonated with Jewish families who desired a toy that celebrated their own traditions. The toy’s popularity surged, capturing the hearts of children and parents alike. Mensch on a Bench became more than just a toy; it became a way for families to immerse themselves in their Jewish heritage and create meaningful holiday experiences.</p><p>“Mensch on a Bench was born out of a desire to provide a Jewish alternative to the Elf on the Shelf and allow families like mine to connect with our own traditions during the holiday season,” said Neal Hoffman, the founder of Mensch on a Bench.</p><p>Through the combination of a soft and lovable plush toy and an engaging storybook, Mensch on a Bench brings the spirit of Hanukkah into homes, serving as a reminder of the importance of Jewish customs, values, and community.
