She also had her name in the press when her relationship with Aaron Rogers ended. But Munn has also made herself a fortune. While some of her net worth can be attributed to a successful film, television, and voice acting career, it was smart business moves that pushed Munn into becoming a multi-millionaire.</p><p>These days, unless an actor is starring in blockbuster film roles, one after another, more often than not, side deals are being done. This is seen in the form of endorsements, modeling, real estate purchases, and business investments. The more that an entertainer can turn themselves into a brand or use their money to venture into areas other than entertainment, the better off they will be when and/or if their careers stall.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/your-paragraph-text-2023-12-05t110052-637.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Fans Noticed Olivia Munn Getting Nervous When She Realized Her Wardrobe With David Letterman Was Too Revealing</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>During Olivia Munn's interview with David Letterman, fans caught the actress looking at herself on the monitor in distress.</span><p>Munn has seamlessly been able to have a successful acting career and take that money earned and grow it.

However, it was not until 2010 that Munn's career began to take off when she was hired as a correspondent on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.

"I like to go towards brands I feel are disruptive or are creating a new space."</p><p>As a result of her investing in the company when it had a $290 million valuation, Munn did quite well for herself.
