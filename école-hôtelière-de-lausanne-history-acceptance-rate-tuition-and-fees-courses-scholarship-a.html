Online Admissions Assessment</h4><p>Upon a positive evaluation of your online application to our bachelor’s program in international hospitality management, you will receive an invitation to complete an online evaluation that includes a 20-minute online interview that you can complete at home. You need a computer, a webcam and access to internet in order to complete the online interview.</p><h4>Step 3. Selection Day</h4><p>If you pass the online evaluation, you will be invited to take part in a selection day. The selection day is an opportunity for us to examine your interests and abilities in much greater depth.<br>We advise you to attend one of our selection days in Lausanne. This will give you a chance to visit our campus, meet members of our faculty and other employees, and talk to current students. If you do not live in Switzerland and are unable to come to Lausanne for your selection day, you may ask to take part in one of our selection days abroad. Such requests are considered on an individual basis.</p><p><strong>Our selection days involve the following activities:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>An interview</li><li>A team-building exercise</li><li>An analytical and quantitative aptitude test</li></ul><p><strong>The interview</strong></p><p>The interview is not a test of your knowledge, and you will not be quizzed on specific facts. The aim is to assess your motivation, your potential and your suitability for the demands of the hospitality industry. We will ask you to tell us about your experience and your expectations. Our questions will focus, for example, on any summer jobs you may have had in the hospitality industry, your extracurricular activities and your international exposure.</p><p><strong>The team-building exercise</strong></p><p>Working in a team will be an important part of your studies at EHL. We therefore would like to see if you enjoy teamwork and if you have the necessary skills needed to work successfully as part of a team.</p><p><strong>The analytical and quantitative aptitude test</strong></p><p>This test is composed of 4 different exams in order to evaluate your leadership, interpersonal skills, analytical reasoning and motivation. This test will be computer-based; that is why we will ask you to bring your own laptop.</p><p><strong>Preparing for your selection day</strong></p><p>No specific preparation is needed. However, to make sure you are choosing the right career, you should find out as much as you can about the hospitality industry, the career opportunities it offers and the training options available in our international hospitality management degree program.</p><h4>Step 4. Final Decision</h4><p>Following the selection day, your complete candidature will be evaluated by the Admissions Committee. Admission to EHL is competitive, and only students who show excellent academic and leadership potential, motivation and interpersonal skills will be selected.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=life-at-ehl></span>Life at EHL<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ2TpLmmeceoq56kmZq%2FpnnDnmSlmaWorq%2B6xGafoqukpL%2B6ecCcmp6opJa7pLGMq5itnV2pwqrAyKilZpmemXqnscSsZJynpafApr%2BMrJqhp5yWv7S0yKlkmqSloruqew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
