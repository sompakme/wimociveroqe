Or run a Laundromat.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. </strong>I play a forensic scientist on TV, but in real life I studied sociology, criminology and psychology.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3.</strong> When I was little, I had a serious eye and leg surgery and was in a body cast.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4.</strong> I was born in New Orleans but grew up all over the South, including Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. </strong>I've been in music videos for <strong><a href=#>Madonna</a></strong>, <strong>Metallica</strong> and <strong>George Michael</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>6.</strong> I enjoy documentaries.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> I love to rescue abandoned critters. They are my life.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>8.</strong> My fiancé, Thomas, is a Royal Marine war veteran and the kindest person I've ever known.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>9.</strong> My favorite thing to do is sit at home with him and our dogs and watch TV.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>10.</strong> I'm a natural blonde.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>11.</strong> I could eat sushi for every meal.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>12.</strong> I watch every episode of NCIS!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>13.</strong> I own a bakery in NYC named after my mom, <a href=#>Donna Bell</a>, who I lost to breast cancer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>14.</strong> The one item I always wanted to buy when I made money was an electric pencil sharpener.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>15.</strong> The spider-web tattoo on my character Abby's neck and the cross on her back are fake. But I have, like, 20 real tattoos.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>16.</strong> I'm also a singer and songwriter. I wrote "Somebody Saved You" in honor of first responders. It's on the NCIS soundtrack.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>17. </strong>My top show of all time is America's Most Wanted.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>18.</strong> I grew up in a Southern church and saw almost no movies or TV as a kid.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>19.</strong> My dresses for awards shows are from charity thrift stores.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>20.</strong> I always keep new socks in my car to give to the homeless. Socks are one of the things they need.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>21.</strong> My favorite shoes are my Converse.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>22.</strong> I have a lot of firefighters in my family.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>23.</strong> I voiced a series of Volkswagen ads.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>24.</strong> I'm allergic to onions and herbs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>25. </strong>I started working in a car lot at 15. After that, I was a cook, a waitress, a bartender — I even wore a sandwich board and roller-skated around, passing out fliers for Taco Bell.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapmaWhsrp5z56pq52kqbJufpRmq6GhnpzAbsXOrmSdp56peqy6zrBkmpqfqsFuucRmaWlpZGeDcns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
