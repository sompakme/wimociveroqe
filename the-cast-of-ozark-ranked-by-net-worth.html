There's no doubt the numerous actors who have had their characters killed off in the first three seasons have benefited from the popularity of the show. This includes the likes of Jordana Spiro, Trevor Long, Tom Pelphrey, Jason Butler Harner, Janet McTeer, and Peter Mullan. All of whome have seen their net worths increase drastically. But what about the cast members on the show who live to see the beginning of season 4? Just how much money do they have going into the finale season?</p><h2 id=carson-holmes-is-worth-100-000><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Carson Holmes Is Worth $100,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carson Holmes, who plays Three on Ozark, is building a respectable net worth for himself, according to ArticleBio. This is especially true given the fact that his main source of income appears to come from Ozark. Although, he also played a small role in Amazon's Uncle Frank and in The Best of Enemies.</p><h2 id=skylar-gaertner-is-worth-300-000><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Skylar Gaertner Is Worth $300,000</span></h2><p>Skylar is best-known for playing Jonah on Ozark but his role of Young Matt Murdock on Netflix's Daredevil and his work in acclaimed Independent films such as I Smile Back has also gained him some notoriety. Still, he's at the beginning of his career. According to StarsGab, Skylar is worth a healthy $300,000. And there's no doubt that number is growing rapidly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sofia-hublitz-is-worth-500-000><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Sofia Hublitz Is Worth $500,000</span></h2><p>The young woman behind Charlotte Byrde is another star on the rise.

Johnson has had small roles in numerous high-profile projects that have built his net worth and his reputation in the business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=felix-solis-is-worth-1-5-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Felix Solis Is Worth $1.5 Million</span></h2><p>Felix Solis plays the big-bad in Ozark, Omar Navarro.
