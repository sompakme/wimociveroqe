Actors get nervous about meeting the Hollywood legend. However, most of us struggle to think about the opposite scenario of Sandler melting under the pressure of meeting a certain individual.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now Sandler admits among the current crop of stars, there really isn't anybody that he gets starstruck over. However, there was one talent in particular that made him nervous, and it was all because of how much she meant to his kids. Speaking alongside Conan O'Brien, Sandler revealed that was none other than Taylor Swift.</p><p>Sandler recalled meeting Swift, stating that he wasn't "cool" during their encounter.</p><p>“What I have found is that people can be absolute icons, make the biggest stars in the world, but if they came along five years ago, I’m very happy to meet them, but they don’t have that effect on me. I’m not like, ‘Oh my, oh my God,’ you know, the way I would be from anybody that I saw [growing up],” O’Brien tells Sandler.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At this point, Sandler reveals why he was starstruck by Swift. “Because what she means to my kids, I get it a little jumpy. Just ’cause I don’t wanna blow it for my kids. So I’m a little like ‘Taylor, Taylor,’ like I talk a little too loud or something. I don’t stay as cool as I can.”</p><p>Sandler concludes, “People talk about The Beatles of it all and her. I mean, man, so many smash hits. There’s not a word my kids don’t know.”</p><p>Even O'Brien agreed with Sandler's assessment. “Yeah, I can see that. Yeah, she’s, I mean, she’s this whole other level now.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/your-paragraph-text-2024-02-05t101503-411.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title='David Spade Called A Scene Adam Sandler Interrupted In The Wrong Missy "Horrifying"'>David Spade Called A Scene Adam Sandler Interrupted In The Wrong Missy "Horrifying"</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Adam Sandler interrupted Bobby Lee while filming 'The Wrong Missy', and kept asking him to repeat his line.</p><p>Credit to Sandler and admitting to being humbled by the artist.
