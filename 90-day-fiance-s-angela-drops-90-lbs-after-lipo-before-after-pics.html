I said, ‘This is something I need to do.'”</p><p>Although recovering hasn’t been easy, the results have been worth it — and the progress will continue.</p><p>“The first three months [were] the hardest months of [my] life,” Angela tells Us of the post-surgery healing. “It’s a journey — not only physically, but an emotional journey because you come out of surgery and you just think everything’s going to change, but actually you can’t eat for a couple months.”</p><p>That said, she completely feels better — and sees the silver lining as the ability to <a href=#>spend more time with her family and Michael</a>. “I did it for myself to stay alive … and [to] benefit the ones I love,” the TLC star says.</p><p><strong>Listen to these must-have summer beauty tips from Bobbi Brown in under 5 minutes!<strong><br></strong></strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see more exclusive photos of Angela’s new look.
