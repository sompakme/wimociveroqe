Despite that, there are still loads of people who want to find their mate who have yet to come across the right person to settle down with no matter how much they’ve tried. In that situation, it makes sense that some people have been willing to try something new. Still, going on <strong><a href=#>Married at First Sight</a> </strong>is an extreme option for a couple of reasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘Married At First Sight’: In A Controversial Season, Briana & Vincent Give Matchmakers Hope</a></span></p><p>First off, even though each season of Married at First Sight ends with some couples opting to stay together, a lot of them <a href=#>wind up splitting in the end</a>. On top of that, there have been a lot of rumors about Married at First Sight possibly being fake. Unfortunately, in recent months, those two issues have both reared their ugly heads as there are new rumors about MAFS being fake and more couples have gone their separate ways.</p><h2 id=married-at-first-sight-couples-that-recently-split-up>Married At First Sight Couples That Recently Split Up</h2><p>When people tune in to watch Married at First Sight, the show does everything it can to convince viewers that the show is all about love. After all, the experts that match up the couples go on and on about why they think each pairing will work. On top of that, when the couples split up, the experts seem to be genuinely upset. Despite all of that, however, the fact of the matter is that Married at First Sight has an extremely spotty history when it comes to couples actually staying together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is Why 'Married At First Sight' Couple Ryan Oubre And Clara Berghaus Divorced</a></span></p><p>Since the beginning of 2021, several Married at First Sight Couples have unfortunately called it quits. For example, Bennett Kirschner & Amelia Fatsi, Ryan Oubre & Clara Berghaus, as well as Bao Hoang & Zack Freeman have all gone their separate ways. While that is sad enough, it is another MAFS couple whose breakup really seemed to upset fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the 13th season of Married at First Sight came to an end, it didn’t take long for it to become clear that it was far from a success in terms of spawning lasting pairings. After all, almost all of the couples went their separate ways almost immediately which <a href=#>left Jose San Miguel and Rachel Gordillo as the only hope</a> for people who believe in love. Sadly, in December of 2021, MAFS fans learned that even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jose and Rachel were getting divorced</a>.</p><h2 id=why-there-are-new-rumors-about-married-at-first-sight-being-fake>Why There Are New Rumors About Married At First Sight Being Fake</h2><p>Unfortunately for anyone who decides to produce a “reality” show, there are a lot of people who don’t take the genre seriously anymore. The reason for that is simple, far too many “reality shows have been proven to at least partially be fake over time. For that reason, from the moment that Married at First Sight debuted, there have been some people who assumed the show is illegitimate.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>It Turns Out These Reality TV Shows Were Always Scripted</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In February of 2022, Married at First Sight fans were given a new reason to think that the show isn’t on the up and up. The reason for that is that an investigation resulted in The Daily Mail publishing a report that seven of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">people who starred in Married at First Sight were actors</a>. Of course, actors need love in their life too so that didn’t necessarily mean anything. However, the problem is that all of the discovered actors were billed as having other jobs on the show.</p><p>For anyone who looks beyond the headlines, it is important to note that it is the Australian version of Married at First Sight that featured the aforementioned actors. As a result, the revelation about the actors may have had nothing to do with the American version of the show at all. However, things rarely are that simple in life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First off, there is one big reason why the revelation about Austalia’s Married at First Sight secretly including actors impacts the American version of the show, people don’t read past headlines. As a result, a lot of people will see the headline about Married at First Sight actors and assume it is about the American version of the show. Second off, since the American version of Married at First Sight featured a wrestler in the first season named Jason Carrion who performs as Jessie Godderz, some people may assume he was a faker too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to the American version of Married at First Sight, there is another reason why some fans think it is misleading. While people who have taken part in the American version of the show say ‘producers do not encourage fights”, they point out that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the show intentionally puts the couples in situations to cause drama</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Married At First Sight: 15 Things Most Fans Don't Know</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqqinrKlecCtZJ%2BhoqjBbr%2FIoJ%2BtZZOkwrG4xKxkm6qVlrhuwc9mmKahlGK%2FtrnOq6pmrJiaerS0zrBkoqtdqsG1sdGlsGaekaCycA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
