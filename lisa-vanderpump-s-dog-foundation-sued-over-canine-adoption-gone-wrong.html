In court documents, the dog owner said she originally adopted a dachshund, named Cassie, from the foundation in July 2019. Though she was told the dog had not received a deworming treatment yet, employees allegedly informed her the dog was safe to play with and hold.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Chris Brown Facing Pricey Lawsuit After His Dog Allegedly Attacks Housekeeper</a></span></p><p>Deworming medications are often administered to treat different sorts of intestinal parasites and heartworms in dogs and other animals, the <a href=#>American Kennel Club</a> explains. There are many different types of worms dogs can attract, but, in general, their symptoms include:</p><ul><li>Diarrhea</li><li><a href=#>Vomiting</a></li><li>Exhaustion</li><li>Weight loss</li><li>Dehydration</li><li>Abdominal pain</li><li>Poor coat appearance</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After spending several hours with the dog, the woman (whose name has not revealed by the media) decided to adopt the pup. The adoption was approved the following day.</p><p>The woman alleges she was very thorough when inquiring into the dog’s medical background. Despite asking several questions, she claims Vanderpump Dog employees promised her Cassie was “in healthy condition.” Additionally, they told her the dog was up-to-date with all of her treatments and shots. As such, the woman took the dachshund home with her.</p><p>Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse when the dog was brought home. The dog’s behaviour began changing, and Cassie was suddenly less playful. The new owner eventually noticed worms in the animal’s stool. She took the dog to the <a href=#>veterinarian</a>, who treated her for a severe worm infection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But the bad experience didn’t end there. Shortly after, the woman says she became violently ill. After a visit to her doctor, she was also diagnosed with an intestinal parasite and put on strong antibiotics. Though she’s recovered, the woman says she still struggles with emotional trauma stemming from the incident, including recurring nightmares, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a> reports.</p><p>Now, the woman has launched a lawsuit against Vanderpump Dogs in hopes of being compensated for the bad experience. She says she tried contacting the foundation several times, but received no response. She believes Vanderpump Dogs falsified Cassie’s immunization records and certifications (including one saying she’d been dewormed), and worries they could be doing the same to other dogs up for adoption.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So far, Lisa Vanderpump, known for her time on <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a>, has not commented on the situation.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Britney Spears Conservator Asking For $220K In Unpaid Fees After Singer's Explosive Testimony</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>American Kennel Club</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE Magazine</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS5qr%2FAZq2appSav7HBzKmqZpyfnHqnu9Snm5qsmaS7br%2FUnpto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
