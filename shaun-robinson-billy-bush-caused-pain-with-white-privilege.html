I’m grateful that it hit me all the way to my core.”</p><p>Bush added that the “big, traumatic event” led him to “acceptance and understanding” as well as “a place of soul searching.” He then “developed a commitment to become a better, fuller man.” He also noted that after the scandal, he “changed in a way that I think will make me better at my job.” He <a href=#>landed his job with Extra</a> in May 2019.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>On the <a href=#>two-year anniversary of the ordeal</a>, the television personality called on others to show more empathy to those who make mistakes. “I have an idea,” he wrote via Instagram in October 2018. “Let’s stop tolerating this escalating war on flaws and the obliteration of people for things we all do. … We are humans and thus fallible.
