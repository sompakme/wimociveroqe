Mariah May took to Twitter to claim that she loves AEW Collision. Deonna Purrazzo replied by asking her to stay there. May took offense to that and responded by stating that she wanted to see Purrazzo wrestle this week on Dynamite. By doing so, she also referred to the former Knockouts Champion as the Jersey Shore personality, Snooki."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

During the interview, Purrazzo <a href=#>revealed</a> the real reason why she was let go from WWE.</p><p>“I mean I’ve talked about it endlessly but it was bad. It was bad. You know, I felt like because I had so much experience working with WWE in an ‘extra’ roll. But then, I was traveling for weeks as Luchadora. I had been on Raw and SmackDown actually wrestling, I had then been on NXT TV a ton. I just felt like… Not that I earned more when I got there that I was given. But there was a respect level that I thought would carry over into now that I got the job I think. And I found out real quick that it didn’t matter that I had done all those things. And it was silly things like, obviously the crowd then, knew who I was.</p><p>“So Live Events you’re expected to like ‘wand’ people at the door. And I’m like, ‘These people know who I am.’ Or like, ‘Be the person that takes jackets from the ringside and bring them to the back.’ I’m totally fine to do that. But I am sitting here and distracting cuz the people want to talk to me. And I was like, ‘Hey I just don’t know if that’s the job for me. Is there a different job I could do?’ And it just rubbed people the wrong way. And it wasn’t that. I didn’t want to do those jobs,” Deonna Purrazzo said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNtZ3JrYWKxprvNp5hmqKWnv6LG2ahkoqueqXqqutKuo62dlGKvunnBnqCnn12Yrq24xJ1krKafpLiq</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
