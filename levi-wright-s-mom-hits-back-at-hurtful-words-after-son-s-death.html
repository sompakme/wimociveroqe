I’d like to share something vulnerable and hard. Unless you’ve been to my place it’s hard to paint a picture of how something like this can happen,” Kallie wrote in an <a href=# rel=noopener>emotional Facebook post</a> shared Thursday, June 6.</p><p>Alongside her caption, Kallie included a video of her family riding on horseback on a property of farmland. She went on to describe the circumstances that led to <a href=#>Levi’s death</a>.</p><p>“There is a creek that runs through our 24 acre property and separates our house from Grandma and Grandpa’s, through that creek is a road made of concrete. It’s how we’ve gotten to their house safely most days as sometimes our dirt road is a nascar raceway,” she wrote. “My kids have rode their bikes, driven their ride on toys & even walked this way a million times. Water only runs through for a short time during the year and can change over night.”</p><p>According to Kallie, her son “did not do anything he hasn’t done before” ahead of his fatal accident. “But this time the water was at its peak & strong enough to push his tractor off the road into the creek as he drove through,” she continued. “He asked me to ride his tractor and I explained that grandma wasn’t home, he shouldn’t drive through the creek or the road and just to ride around the house. As he drove off, I ran back in the house. That’s a decision that will haunt me for the rest of my life. In that moment he was my responsibility alone.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Levi-Wright-Mom-Kallie-Wright-Hits-Back-at-Hurtful-Words-After-3-Year-Old-Death-2.jpg><p>Kallie noted that she “honestly” doesn’t recall why she went back inside, adding, “Whatever it was, wasn’t more important than following him that day.”</p><p>Despite believing everything happens for a reason, Kallie admitted that she “will lose sleep over this for eternity.” She also defended herself against those who may have <a href=#>criticized her parenting</a> after learning of her family’s loss.</p><p>“I know 3 things to be true,” she wrote. “1. I am not a perfect mom but I am a good mom. 2. My little boy loved me with all he had. 3. Never say never because it only takes seconds and it can happen to you too. I pray anyone who judges me or has hurtful words to say never finds themself on the receiving end of a nightmare like this.”</p><p>Levi died on June 2, two weeks after suffering a severe brain injury. Levi was <a href=#>hospitalized late last month</a> after driving his toy tractor into a river in Utah. Following the accident, the Beaver County Sheriff’s Office noted in a May 21 statement that Levi was “quickly located” and “life saving measures” were taken before he was transferred to a nearby hospital.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Wright family was initially uncertain whether their son would make a full recovery, and <a href=#>updates about his condition</a> were provided via social media. Family friend <strong>Mindy Sue Clark</strong> confirmed Levi’s death to People on June 3.</p><p>“Levi was the absolute best little boy,” she said. “It’s going to be tough navigating life without him.”</p><p>Kallie and Spencer are also the parents of daughter Steeley and son Brae. Spencer has yet to publicly address Levi’s death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGalnaaeeri%2ByKCfratdoryueceiq6xlkpawrHnArWShraKps7a4jLCmq5yjYq6nwMSrZKynnqh6pbHArZ9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
