Considering <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Princess Diana</a> was widely loved by people worldwide, the public was not happy when they discovered that Prince Charles had been cheating on her for most of their marriage. Despite the unfortunate events that occurred, Diana's legacy remains intact due to her children, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince William and Prince Harry.&nbsp;</a></p><p>As time passed by, the Royal Family became more lenient towards areas of life such as divorce, allowing Charles and Camilla to officially wed in 2005. Although things may appear to be happy-go-lucky now, there are still a number of questions that many of us want answers to. Here are some answers to questions regarding Charles and Camilla that many of us still don't know about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-did-prince-charles-begin-his-affair-with-camilla><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>When Did Prince Charles Begin His Affair With Camilla?</span></h2><p>Prince Charles and Princess Diana's relationship remain one of the many mysteries surrounding the British Royal Family. While they appeared to be happy at first, it was made clear that the two were simply not a perfect match. Despite being married, Prince Charles began having an affair with long-time friend and former girlfriend, Camila Parker Bowles. The two had officially met in 1970 at a polo match, but their affair began in 1986, according to Prince Charles's authorized biography.</p><h2 id=did-princess-diana-know-about-it><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Did Princess Diana Know About It?</span></h2><p>Prince Charles and Princess Diana married in 1981 in what was one of the biggest royal weddings to date, however, things turned sour quite fast. It was made evident that the two were having issues in their marriage from the get-go, however, only five years in, Prince Charles had begun his affair with Camila, and you bet that Princess Diana knew. When asked about her marriage to Prince Charles, Diana had mentioned that there were three people involved, making it clear that she knew very well about his affair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-didn-t-prince-charles-divorce-diana><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Why Didn't Prince Charles Divorce Diana?</span></h2><p>Considering how unhappy both Prince Charles and Princess Diana were in their marriage, it would have made sense for the two to divorce early on, allowing Charles to freely and openly date Camila. Although that sounds like a feasible plan, it was against everything the Royal Family and the church stood for. Additionally, considering Prince Charles would one day become King, he would also be the head of the church, which would not be possible if he were to have been divorced. Luckily, the rules were loosened years later, allowing Charles and Diana to finalize their divorce in 1996.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince Charles Feels Better After Didgeridoo Blessing</a></span></p><h2 id=was-camilla-also-married-at-the-time><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Was Camilla Also Married At The Time?</span></h2><p>In addition to Prince Charles being married to Diana, Camila Bowles Parker was also married at the time too. Camila had married Andrew Parker Bowles in 1973, and also found herself in an unhappy marriage. Considering both Charles and Camila were married to other people, this created an even bigger scandal, one that the Royal Family was not at all happy about. Camila later divorced Andrew Bowles in 1995 after already having had a nine-year affair with Charles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-the-queen-deal-with-the-affair><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>How Did The Queen Deal With The Affair?</span></h2><p>Queen Elizabeth II remains the longest standing monarch in history, so it is safe to say that she has dealt with a number of scandals throughout her time. Although she has managed to cover up a number of secrets, it appears she was not able to end this one. Prince Charles's affair with Camila was never truly confirmed to the public until after Princess Diana's death, despite us knowing exactly what was happening. The Queen certainly did not like what was going on and made things extremely difficult for her eldest son, however, it appears that love won in this case.</p><h2 id=was-camilla-welcomed-into-the-royal-family><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Was Camilla Welcomed Into The Royal Family?</span></h2><p>Camilla may have had a rough start with the Royal Family but things soon became normal as time passed on. The Duchess was always in Royal company growing up, so she was no stranger to the Royal Family or royal protocol, however, her divorce made things much harder for her. After Princess Diana's death in 1997, Camilla and Charles laid low for quite a while only re-emerging in 1999 as an official couple. While it didn't happen overnight, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Royal Family and the general public would soon come around to accepting Camilla.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Queen Elizabeth II Is On Instagram, And You Should Follow Her</a></span></p><h2 id=will-camilla-carry-the-title-of-queen-of-england><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Will Camilla Carry The Title Of 'Queen Of England'?</span></h2><p>Camilla has certainly found her place in the Royal Family and has been accepted and welcomed with open arms now. Although she is married to Prince Charles, who will one day become King, Camilla will not be the Queen. While this may sound strange, considering a woman married to a King is usually referred to as the Queen Consort, Camilla will not adopt this title. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Duchess will be known as the Princess Consort</a>, which was the agreement made back in 2005 when she married Prince Charles.</p><h2 id=did-charles-amp-camilla-ever-want-to-have-kids><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Did Charles & Camilla Ever Want To Have Kids?</span></h2><p>Despite Camila and Charles having met over 50 years ago, the two could not have kids of their own, even if they wanted. During their affair, if Charles and Camila were to have a child of their own, they would have easily been exiled from the Royal Family for breaking protocol, and a big one at that. Having a child out of wedlock was a big faux pas, and still is amongst many Royals across the globe. Although they did officially marry one another in 2005, they were both well into their 50s and children were no longer a main concern.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Cutest Pictures Of The British Royal Family</a></span></p><h2 id=do-the-two-actually-have-a-love-child><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Do The Two Actually Have A Love Child?</span></h2><p>Although they may have never been able to have a child of their own, that we know of at least, it appears there have been many rumours that the two did, in fact, conceive a child! A man by the name of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Simon Dorante-Day claims that he is the love child to Charles and Camila</a>. His claims say that he was adopted at 18 months old by his now grandmother who once worked the Queen, and told him that he was Prince Charles and Camilla's son. Despite him being convinced, it appears the dates do not match up well enough for this to be a viable rumour.</p><h2 id=where-do-the-two-stand-today><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Where Do The Two Stand Today?</span></h2><p>After years of a bumpy start, marriages, love child rumours and a difficult start to being a member of the Royal Family, it appears as if Camilla has earned her spot as the Duchess of Cornwall. While things appear great on the outside, we are certain that Camilla has and always will feel a sense of being different considering how she joined the family. Despite what others may think, Prince Charles and Camilla remain very much in love, and it looks as if the two finally got their happy ever after.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here Is Why Prince Harry & Prince William Aren't As Close As Before</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinq6GemLJur8eaqaWdo2KwornIpaOaZZSerq%2BtjKumspmcYrOiucilsGaekZjBtHnRrqSoqqNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
