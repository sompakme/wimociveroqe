However, though she constantly brags about her handsome and talented husband and three children on air for the past couple of years, there is a lot of details that she leaves out.</p><p>If you're a huge fan of the loveable Kelly, then you know that she is not afraid to talk about anything and everything; she has never been one that has been shy to share her opinion on her family and general life topics. We all know that it is a little over 20 years she is married to the love of her life and that her children (sometimes) drive her up the wall. The perky host has had an impressive career and has made people laugh and smile in their very homes for years now, but there are many quirks that Kelly managed to keep quiet about her and her family's life. We know she is a hard-working woman who can do it all; a soap opera star turned sitcom actress, turned host, and a wife and mother at the same time. Everything seems perfect about Kelly's life, and so, here are things we are certain you do not know about the talk show host and her family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hubby-mark-consuelos-was-a-go-go-dancer><strong>Hubby Mark Consuelos Was a go-go dancer</strong></h2><p>We love seeing Kelly and Mark together, in fact, when Kelly finally found her co-host, which is now Ryan Seacrest, we were sad to see the hunky and talented actor go. And since Mark is easy on the eyes, and we could all agree on that, there is a secret from his past that Kelly has not disclosed often. However, in an interview with Vanity Fair, Kelly admitted that her hubby was once a go-go dancer. Yes, the Riverdale actor who is loyal and faithful to his wife was once upon a time an adult dancer. According to Kelly, she does have photos of her Italian and Mexican partner on an old calendar.</p><h2 id=the-couple-battled-rumours><strong>The Couple Battled Rumours</strong></h2><p>If there is one thing Kelly is not afraid to do, it is to stand up and set things straight. However, something she never mentions again and never puts back on the table is the allegations that surfaced in 2007 about a divorce. Evidently, in Hollywood, tabloids like to juice things up, and they claimed that their marriage was being torn apart because of Consuelos' flirting and unnecessary spending. While the couple still stood tall, Hollywood continued to try and break them down, so a year later, Kelly told the world to "have a nice day" when she released a statement bashing the National Enquirer. All these years later, Kelly has kept this on the DL.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-children-didn-t-watch-tv><strong>The Children&nbsp;didn't watch TV</strong></h2><p>How odd is it to think that two parents who make a living on television would completely ban their children from watching television? The two television stars, at some point, did not allow their children to watch cartoons like most kids. Both being brought up in European-American households, they carried on their old-school ways and only let their children watch TV on the weekends. It was not crazy of the TV star parents to implement this rule, but we also find it sort of hypocritical. We get school is important, and it avoided TV remote fights, but it is TV after all that provided them with a rich living, so they should not have made TV seem so evil to the children.</p><h2 id=they-have-a-production-company><strong>They Have A Production Company</strong></h2><p>Through funny little tidbits Kelly has shared on her show, we feel like we have gotten to know her cherished children Michael, Lola, and Joaquin. And to show the endless love they have for their children, what most do not know is that the power couple have a production company that they started in 2007 and named it Milojo, which is dedicated to their children. Kelly has an amazing personality that shines every morning, but she never talks live about her and her smoke-show hubby’s very successful production company. Named after their children, it has produced several critically acclaimed projects and continues to go strong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-secret-to-their-marriage><strong>The Secret To Their Marriage</strong></h2><p>How has their relationship in the limelight of Hollywood lasted so long? Not something Kelly addressed on Live!, but on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, Kelly confidently spoke about her everlasting romantic relationship. People hesitate to question Kelly about her marriage and the secret to keeping the spark alive. However, like Kelly said, "There’s no secret! We just like each other a lot. I really — I love my husband! I think he’s awesome. We’ve been together a long time and we try to do spicy things together all the time.” We don't blame the two for still desiring one another, but we were not aware of their still "spicy" marriage.</p><h2 id=kelly-on-her-relationship><strong>Kelly On Her&nbsp;relationship</strong></h2><p>Despite how faultless their marriage seems, it is very rare we hear of the downfalls the A-list couple experience because Kelly is not prone to talk about those on Live!. However, those who follow the show religiously will recall the moment that Kelly cited how mean her husband is toward her after doing the deed ― woah there Kelly, we are not sure we were good on hearing that. After hubby Mark addressed his wife's claim, he came on the show to say that he passes out immediately, so what she said is not valid. For whatever reason, Kelly may feel that way, she has since then not expressed her feelings about the situation again. A secret that should not have been spilled the first time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-kind-of-developed-insomnia><strong>She Kind Of Developed Insomnia</strong></h2><p>Despite her awesome work and amazing personality, it seems to us that Kelly often seems stressed she always wants things to be perfect. She has steadily worked hard and that is what probably keeps the TV host up at night. However, something Kelly has tried to keep to herself is her apparent post-traumatic talk show disorder. That's a thing? When Kelly first started on Live! With Regis and Kelly, she was often criticized and bashed by viewers. So, what did Kelly do? Kelly started to lack a great amount of sleep as she stayed up all night thinking about the show.</p><h2 id=kelly-and-mark-s-sleeping-habits-don-t-coincide><strong>Kelly And Mark’s Sleeping Habits Don’t Coincide</strong></h2><p>Speaking of sleeping habits, it appears the Hollywood couple are the complete opposite ― again, this is something that Kelly professionally does not like to discuss. Though the two are still so happily in love, Kelly did mention on Jimmy Kimmel Live!&nbsp;that her husband suffers from a term she invented personally for him called "maroklepsy," because Consuelos seems to pass out just about anywhere; in the bathroom, car, and funnily enough, at an award show. However, while hubby sleeps like a champion, Kelly gets barely five hours of sleep a night, which alarms her husband. Somehow, they are still going strong and we have not heard of the sleeping situation since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelly-has-a-say-over-her-daughter-s-outfits><strong>Kelly Has A Say Over Her Daughter’s Outfits</strong></h2><p>As one of the most popular American TV hosts, being a mother could be a difficult task, especially when her other half is out in Vancouver filming for Riverdale. Though her children seem very well-behaved and well-mannered, we believe it is because she is a tough mother. However, Kelly seems to be a little more protective of her drop-dead gorgeous daughter, Lola, who is voluptuous and a mix of both stunning parents. Kelly has a great fashion sense, but what we don't know is that she is very strict with her daughter and what she wears. Her teenage daughter has a beautiful figure and evidently her mamma does not want her to dress too provocatively.</p><h2 id=kelly-is-not-a-fan-of-social-media><strong>Kelly Is Not A Fan Of Social Media</strong></h2><p>In a world with people that are slaves to social media, especially in Hollywood, it appears there is no more privacy. Stars and their families need to be uber careful in what they post to their social media accounts because the whole world instantly sees. Kelly recently got on the 'Gram and created an account, but as a mother who is also a star, she pays very close attention to what her children post. In fact, Kelly monitors all her children's social media constantly, even if they are now mature teens/adults.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelly-monitors-her-children-s-phones><strong>Kelly Monitors Her Children’s Phones</strong></h2><p>To continue with the previous point, Kelly has openly admitted about her "controlling" ways with her children. However, it is not something that the TV host often brings up because she has a reputation to uphold to continue in success. When she did though, she admitted going through her children's phones and having their passcodes. Why? "Privacy is for if you want to write a letter or write in your journal, I'm not going to read that. But if you want to tweet about what a pain in the butt your mom is, I'm gonna see that."</p><h2 id=their-secret-to-a-close-family><strong>Their Secret To A Close Family</strong></h2><p>They have become an iconic couple in Hollywood and are overly admired for their adorable marriage ― they seem to still have that puppy love. However, with three children who are all much older now, with Michael, their eldest, who is already 21 years old, they try their best to keep the family tight knit. The reason why they are so well-respected as a couple in the showbiz is because their family seems so gracefully perfect. However, their secret to keeping a healthy family is always having dinner together. According to Kelly, they try as hard as possible to have family dinner every night since that is how Mark wants it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelly-and-her-diva-behaviour><strong>Kelly And Her Diva Behaviour</strong></h2><p>Before Ryan Seacrest came along, there was Michael Strahan, and what a joy it was to watch the friendly giant and the bubbly Kelly. However, suddenly, in April 2016, Strahan announced his departure to start work at Good Morning America, and it caused havoc in the stressed TV host's life. This happened unexpectedly, which is what lead to a meltdown on Kelly's end, as she claimed she felt totally blindsided. Sources said Kelly had a total breakdown, causing her to call off work for days at a time. While some staffers claimed that this was classic Kelly Ripa behaviour, is she a diva after all?</p><h2 id=kelly-is-not-there-to-be-friends-with-her-children><strong>Kelly Is Not There To Be Friends With Her Children</strong></h2><p>Now that you have learnt a little bit more about the perky host as a mother and about her family, we want to also inform you that frankly, Kelly does not care whether her kids like her or not. Parents are there to help guide and protect, and we get where her kids are coming from, they're teenagers and are at that phase in their lives where they are trying to find themselves. However, Kelly takes school very seriously and does not care if her children are hating on her right now. In fact, she once said about Lola that she took away her phone and computer because "she broke the rules. She was texting when she should have been studying for Spanish."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelly-treated-strahan-like-dust-in-the-wind><strong>Kelly Treated Strahan Like Dust In The Wind</strong></h2><p>Kelly is also an actress, so you may have been fooled by the smile she was fronting while still filming on air with Strahan after his departure. Many of you may not be aware of this, but because of Kelly, there was tons of drama between the two; hey, she blindsided us too. Also, because Kelly is very sarcastic, but also direct, it is hard to tell when the host is being serious or not. According to an insider that was close to the two, Kelly really was not kind to Strahan behind closed doors. In fact, in Page Six, it was said that "[Ripa and Strahan] did not get along. It was all for the show. They could not stand each other, and whenever they communicated off camera, it was always through their reps." Harsh!</p><h2 id=kelly-and-mark-eloped><strong>Kelly And Mark Eloped</strong></h2><p>Most Hollywood couples make a huge deal of their wedding, but Kelly and Mark, who were then just soap stars, did things secretly. It is not often mentioned, but the former All My Children stars eloped and headed to Las Vegas to exchange their vows. Oddly enough, even huge fans of Kelly do not know this about the couple; it certainly isn't something Kelly wants to discuss. However, when she openly did, she said they eloped because everyone else in their families had just had weddings too, so they didn't want the big party. That is pretty surprising for two Italian families!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-reason-why-mark-did-not-want-to-be-co-host><strong>The Reason Why Mark Did Not Want To Be Co-host</strong></h2><p>As much as we love seeing Kelly and Mark together when he makes appearances on Live!, there is a reason why when Strahan left, he did not take a shot at the job beside his wife permanently. Mark is no stranger to being on stage, so we knew it had nothing to do with confidence, instead, it had to do with Mark being protective. Their marriage has been thriving for 22 years and Kelly admitted in the past that Mark would have never accepted the spot working alongside his wife because he values their marriage and said he doesn't believe they could stay married if they both were on the show.</p><h2 id=kelly-s-first-gig><strong>Kelly’s First Gig</strong></h2><p>Kelly is often very silly on Live!&nbsp;and is not scared to show off her amazing personality, but one thing about herself that she has kept concealed is her musical capabilities. We guess it is a secret of hers that she does not want to disclose, but before her soap opera gig and on-air job, Kelly was on the reality show Dancin’ On Air. Yes, the perky host with a tiny frame was once a ballet dancer. And along with that, she was also taught how to play the piano and sing as a child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelly-and-regis-don-t-speak><strong>Kelly And Regis Don’t Speak</strong></h2><p>Is it not coincidental that it has been said that Kelly also does not hear from Regis Philbin? The two who were together on air for years, and while Regis was the star of the show, they seemed like the closest friends; their admiration for one another was completely obvious, Regis even nicknamed Kelly “Pippa.” After 11 years of working together though, Regis and Kelly have not spoken since their last time sitting side by side. According to Regis, in 2017, he told Larry King Now, "She got very offended when I left. She thought I was leaving because of her." Oh Kelly, it ain't always about you.</p><h2 id=kelly-supports-charities><strong>Kelly Supports Charities</strong></h2><p>For some odd reason, even though Kelly is always chatting away, she never talks about the charities her and her hubby are involved in. We believe it is for personal reasons, but nowadays, it is pretty simple to figure things out. For one, Kelly is an active member of MADD because sister Linda was badly injured and nearly died in a car accident. Another charity she supports is the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund. However, it seems like Kelly keeps this all under wraps instead of using her celebrity status.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>References:&nbsp;<a href=#>dazzling.news</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>nickiswift.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>fame10.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYmV6rbXTraOeZZujvLi6jJ2crZmZocBurcGorK1lm5q5rcWMq6CpmV2Wu6V5x56pZp6RoratxYyfmKerXay8trjDZpmeZaOqv7G%2ByKycnWWkpHqsus6wZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
