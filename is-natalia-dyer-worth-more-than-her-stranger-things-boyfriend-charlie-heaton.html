However, one thing was clear according to one of Stranger Things' co-creators, stars <a href=#>Charlie Heaton and Natalia Dyer had chemistry from the moment they met</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Heaton and Dyer met and became a couple, Stranger Things fans all over the world eventually learned about their relationship. Even after that, the couple has mostly avoided talking about their relationship in great detail.</p><p>As a result of the fact that Dyer and Heaton prefer to maintain their privacy, <a href=#>there still are a lot of mysteries about their relationship</a>. While it is perfectly reasonable for Heaton and Dyer to want to keep their relationship private, that doesn't mean that nothing is known about the couple.</p><p>On top of the few details about their relationship that Dyer and Heaton have revealed, there have also been reports about both of them. As a result, fans can learn which one of the two actors has a larger fortune based on reports.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-is-charlie-heaton-worth>How Much Money Is Charlie Heaton Worth?</h2><p>Before Charlie Heaton became famous, the talented young actor started his career by landing small roles in minor projects that flew under the radar. During those early days in his career, nobody seemed to have big plans for Heaton.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Charlie Heaton's Secret Child</a></span></p><p>Thanks to the fact that Heaton brought so much heart to his performance as Stranger Things' Jonathan Byers, he has earned a lot of opportunities in recent years. Most notably, Heaton was cast in a major comic book movie.</p><p>Hired to portray Samuel Guthrie in the X-Men spin-off film The New Mutants, it was a big deal that Heaton was chosen to play the character that is better known as Cannonball. In fact, Heaton's casting easily could have resulted in some huge things for the actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/joe-keery-natalia-dyer-and-charlie-heaton.jpg><p>Sadly, The New Mutants' release was delayed over and over and the movie ultimately underperformed critically and commercially. Still, Heaton had already been paid for his role in the film by then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of The New Mutants, Heaton has also starred in other movies like Marrowbone, No Future, and The Souvenir Part II among others. Of course, Heaton's best-known role to date has been starring in all four seasons of Stranger Things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/This-Is-Why-Natalia-Dyer-And-Charlie-Heaton-Hid-Their-Relationship-For-So-Long-copy.jpg><p>Thanks to all the high-profile roles that Heaton has landed, he has managed to accumulate more money than a lot of people see in a lifetime. According to celebritynetworth.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heaton has a $4 million fortune</a> as of this writing.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-is-natalia-dyer-worth>How Much Money Is Natalia Dyer Worth?</h2><p>Just like her longtime boyfriend, Natalia Dyer was busy building her resume before she landed the role that made her a star. Perhaps most memorably, Dyer landed a relatively small role in the Disney film Hannah Montana: The Movie before she became famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Surprising Facts About Stranger Things' Natalia Dyer</a></span></p><p>Once the first season of Stranger Things premiered, many viewers couldn't get enough of Dyer's performance as Nancy Wheeler. Able to imbue Nancy with an inner strength that made viewers truly believe the character would never stop until she got answers, Dyer has played a pivotal role in every Stranger Things season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/natalia-dyer-and-charlie-heaton.jpg><p>Given how much fans enjoyed Dyer in Stranger Things, it makes sense that she has consistently landed movie roles since her rise to fame. Unfortunately for Dyer, however, she hasn't gotten the chance to star in a blockbuster movie yet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to all the success that Dyer has enjoyed throughout her career, she has also managed to earn a huge net worth. According to celebritynetworth.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dyer currently has a $4 million fortune</a>.</p><h2 id=is-natalia-dyer-or-charlie-heaton-more-likely-to-make-more-money-in-the-future>Is Natalia Dyer Or Charlie Heaton More Likely To Make More Money In The Future?</h2><p>Given that Natalia Dyer and Charlie Heaton's careers have mirrored each other's in a lot of ways, it makes sense that they reportedly are worth the same amount. That said, there is no denying that learning that they have the same estimated net worth as each other is very anticlimactic.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>A Look Inside Stranger Things Stars Natalia Dyer And Charlie Heaton's Romantic Relationship Off-Screen</a></span></p><p>On the bright side, it still is fascinating to look at the future of Dyer and Heaton's careers and make an educated guess about which one will be worth more in the future.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/charlie-heaton-and-natalia-dyer-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As was previously pointed out, none of the studios have hired Dyer to star in a major movie like The New Mutants yet. While The New Mutants wasn't a hit for Heaton, it still is significant that Fox hired him to star in a film series they had big plans for at the time.</p><p>On the other hand, as of the time of this writing, Heaton doesn't have any announced movie roles that are listed on either Wikipedia or IMDb. Fortunately for Dyer, she is set to star in a pair of upcoming movies according to Wikipedia, Chestnut and All Fun and Games.</p><p>Considering that Stranger Things is Heaton and Dyer's main claim to fame, it also is interesting to look at their roles in the show to date.</p><p>After fans watched Stranger Things' fourth season, many of them were surprised by the reduced role that Jonathan Byers had in the season. After all, Jonathan had very little impact on the season's storyline aside from helping Mike get to Eleven and even then, he pretty much was just along for the ride.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/natalia-dyer-charlie-heaton-stranger-things.jpg><p>Unlike Jonathan, Nancy played a huge role in the fourth season of Stranger Things. Alongside Robin, Nancy uncovered the facts about the season's main villain and on top of that, she traveled to the upside down and was in the middle of the action there.</p><p>While Heaton's fans hope for Jonathan to have a much larger role in Stranger Things' fifth season, as of now it seems like Nancy is better positioned to steal the spotlight. If Nancy truly does play a huge role in the fifth season, it will be more likely that Dyer will land roles in notable movies and shows in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the current prospects for their careers going forward, it seems probable that Dyer will be wealthier than Heaton in the future. Of course, that is just an educated guess and anything can happen going forward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilmqyRobaiecOynKtlkaOxbq%2FHmqmloZVitaat06ilZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
