A radio personality broadcasting primarily in the Chicago-area market, Mancow Muller is most widely recognized for his show, “Mancow’s Morning Madhouse”. After being fired from multiple radio stations for what many refer to as his continually “lewd” commentary, he is currently hosting a Sunday night broadcast.</p><p>Matthew Erich Muller was born in Kansas City, Missouri in June 1966. As a kid he expressed an interest in radio and would listen to classic radio shows on tape. She became a model and child actor and his print modeling work included Wal-Mart and Lee jeans. He played a half-man half-animal while in college that earned him the nickname of Mancow. He earned double degrees from Central Missouri State University in Theatre and Public Relations. He had his own mobile DJ business. His radio career started off playing commercials late night during broadcasts of The Larry King Show. He later got his own afternoon show and became head of station promotions. In 1990 he got hired as the morning drive talent at KBEQ-FM in Kansas City. He headed to Monterey, CA and then San Francisco. In 1993 his publicity stunt involving major traffic caused national headlines and earned him three years probation. He started working at The Blaze in Chicago in 1994 and created his new show Mancow’s Morning Madhouse. He and his show have had numerous run-ins with the Federal Communications Commission over the years. Mancow can be described as a shock jock in the vein of Howard Stern. He co-stared with brother Mark on the History Channel reality show God, Guns & Automobiles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1foq6vr86wZKatnKGys7%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jJugqJ%2Bilr2pxYyfmJysXZius7HEq2Sar5GnsbR5wKebZqSZm7Juv9OoqbJn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
