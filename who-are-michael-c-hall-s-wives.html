For example, many fans have followed <a href=#>everything that Jennifer Carpenter has been up to since Dexter ended</a>. Similarly, some fans want to know everything they can about star Michael C. Hall’s private life including who the three women he has married are.</p><h2 id=michael-c-hall-rsquo-s-first-wife-amy-spanger-is-an-actor>Michael C. Hall’s First Wife, Amy Spanger, Is An Actor</h2><p>Back when Michael C. Hall was best known for playing Six Feet Under’s David Fisher, he was involved with a fellow actor named Amy Spanger. After getting married in 2002, Hall and Spanger initially seemed happy together from the outside looking in. On top of spending their time off together, Hall and Spanger co-starred in a stage production of Chicago together as Billy Flynn and Roxie Hart respectively. In 2005, Spanger and Hall separated before going on to divorce in 2006.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Charlie Sheen's First Wife, Donna Peele?</a></span></p><p>On top of appearing on stage with her ex-husband during their marriage, Amy Spanger landed small roles in a lot of notable projects. For example, Spanger appeared in the movie Synecdoche, New York and she showed up in several shows including Ed, Becker, Six Feet Under, Law & Order: SVU, The Blacklist, and Chicago Med.</p><h2 id=michael-c-hall-and-jennifer-carpenter-went-from-co-stars-to-husband-and-wife>Michael C. Hall And Jennifer Carpenter Went From Co-Stars To Husband And Wife</h2><p>When Michael C. Hall landed the lead role in the show Dexter, he must have been overjoyed. After all, Dexter was based on a series of successful books and it was produced by Showtime which made it seem like it had every chance of becoming a hit. Of course, Dexter would ultimately become a huge success and make Hall more famous than at any other time in his career. As it turned out, Dexter changed Hall’s life in another way that was a lot more meaningful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter were hired to star as Dexter’s two main characters that are siblings, it didn’t take long for the two actors to fall for each other. Of course, given the nature of the characters they brought to life on TV, it makes sense that Hall and Carpenter were reluctant to announce their love for each other to the world at first. After they began dating in 2007, Hall and Carpenter eloped on New Year’s Eve in 2008 and then let the world in on their union in January 2009.</p><p>During Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter’s marriage, she stood by his side when he underwent treatment for a form of Hodgkin's lymphoma. In fact, Carpenter even was the one who announced that Hall was in full remission in April 2010. Even though their union seemed strong, Hall and Carpenter finalized their divorce in 2011. Continuing to co-star in Dexter and its revival for years after their split, It is a good thing that Hall and Carpenter remained friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dexter Revival May Change The Show's Reputation For Having A Terrible Ending</a></span></p><p>On top of being best known for starring in Dexter, Jennifer Carpenter has been excellent in other roles. For example, Carpenter was incredible in The Exorcism of Emily Rose and her work in the underrated TV adaptation of the movie Limitless deserves more credit. An extremely talented actor, Carpenter should be on the shortlist for every Hollywood casting agent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-c-hall-rsquo-s-current-wife-morgan-macgregor-is-a-book-reviewer-and-novelist>Michael C. Hall’s Current Wife Morgan MacGregor Is a Book Reviewer And Novelist</h2><p>When looking back at Michael C. Hall’s romantic history, it quickly becomes clear that he used to have a thing for dating actors. For that reason, it is notable that Hall is now married to Morgan MacGregor since she is not a performer. Instead, MacGregor is a novelist who works as a book reviewer professionally. During a 2018 Daily Beast interview, Hall spoke about how his third wife’s literary knowledge has improved his life. “I suppose […] I probably benefit more from her expertise than she does from mine. She has a unique ability to place books with people, myself included, so that’s a nice perk.”</p><p>Long Before he talked to the Daily Beast about his wife Morgan MacGregor’s ability to pick out the right books for him, Michael C. Hall and Morgan MacGregor walked down the aisle in 2016. Even though she is a native of Canada, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MacGregor has built a life with Hall in New York City</a> where they own a 2-bedroom apartment in the Upper West Side. According to reports, Hall and MacGregor paid $4.3 million for their apartment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Michael C.
