Kelce appeared next to Taylor’s father, <strong>Scott Swift</strong>, who was <a href=#>wearing a Chiefs lanyard</a>, and opening act <a href=#><strong>Sabrina Carpenter</strong> </a>later<a href=#> joined him</a> in the tent. The couple had been <a href=#>spotted on a dinner date</a> in the city the night prior.</p><p>While Kelce previously <a href=#>attended Swift’s Kansas City concert</a> in July, this marks the first time that he has been in the crowd at one of her tour stops since the couple began dating.</p><p>Earlier this week, Kelce hinted that <a href=#>he would be traveling to see Swift</a> on the South American leg of her tour. His brother, <a href=#><strong>Jason Kelce</strong></a>, asked during the Wednesday, November 8, episode of their “New Heights” podcast whether there were any events Travis was “looking forward to going to” in the near future.</p><p>“No, not really. … I might just say ‘f—k it’ and just go somewhere nice, I don’t know,” Travis teased. “My skin’s getting real pale. I gotta go somewhere sunny.”</p><p>When Jason wanted to know whether Travis was heading “someplace south,” Travis replied, “Closer to the equator.”</p><p>Although Travis has <a href=#>played coy about his relationship with Swift</a> in recent weeks, he was initially forthcoming about <a href=#>attempting to meet her</a> when she played Arrowhead Stadium in July. He revealed at the time that he was unable to give her the friendship bracelet he made with his phone number on it, but he later invited her to <a href=#>attend one of his games in Kansas City</a> in September, which she accepted.</p><p>Swift has <a href=#>supported Travis at four games</a>, and his team has yet to lose with her in the stands. While she <a href=#>missed his most recent match</a> against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday, November 5, in Germany, she was spotted <a href=#>spending time with the wives of several Chiefs players</a> in New York City — including <a href=#><strong>Brittany Mahomes</strong></a>, who is <a href=#>married to quarterback</a> <a href=#><strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong></a> — over the weekend.</p><p>“Travis and Taylor are a very real couple, they actually spend a lot of one-on-one time together and have developed a very real connection,” a source told Us Weekly this month. “They have very detailed plans coming up on how to stay together while she’s on tour and he has games.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Travis was able to make the trip to Argentina because the Chiefs are on a bye week, giving him time off from practicing and playing. Their next game will be against the Philadelphia Eagles (his brother Jason’s team) on November 20.</p><p>Swift, meanwhile, will perform two more shows in Argentina on Friday, November 10, and Saturday, November 11. She will then <a href=#>travel to Brazil for six concerts</a>, wrapping up her final tour date of the year on November 26. The <a href=#>Eras Tour will later resume</a> in Tokyo in February 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGrtrR5yp6jnJ1dlsG1sc2dqmaska65sL6MrK6inqSoeqa%2BwKxkraelp3qquoyaqaCdnqm2r62O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
