Some think he's a hero, some think he's a slimeball, and others are just harmlessly fascinated by it.</p><p>Well, the saga continues with Pete's latest alleged romantic fling; his Bodies, Bodies, Bodies co-star, Chase Sui Wonders. If Chase looks familiar, it's certainly because of her role in HBO Max's Generation as well as the fact that she dated another TV hottie, Riverdale's Charles Melton.</p><h2 id=who-has-chase-sui-wonders-dated>Who Has Chase Sui Wonders Dated?</h2><p>Harvard graduate Chase Sui Wonders first started her career making and starring in her own work. But soon she was discovered by a variety of filmmakers, including Sofia Coppola. However, it was HBO Max's Generation that really put her on the map due to feature her in one of the main roles. Since then, she has been cast in a number of notable projects and doesn't seem to stop working.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chase-sui-wonders-movie-premiere.jpg><p>However, since Chase Sui Wonders is still at the beginning of her career, not a lot is known about her relationship history. There's no doubt she has had a couple of boyfriends, but the only famous one appears to be Riverdale's Charles Melton.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chase-sui-wonders-boyfriend-charles-melton.jpg><p>Of course, Charles Melton was famous for dating his Riverdale co-star, Camila Mendes. But the pair confirmed that they amicably split in December 2019. That's despite rumors that they had a bit of an on-and-off again thing in the years following. But both Charles and Camila have moved on with their lives by 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Adam Levine And Pete Davidson Have Caused Endless Controversy Over Their Tattoos</a></span></p><p>Fans were initially excited when <a href=#>Charles Melton and Chase Sui Wonders confirmed their romance</a>. While they were first linked in January 2022, it took until July for them to publicly address it, according to J-14. Since then, the pair have posted numerous PDA-filled images together, including of them on vacation with Charles's Riverdale co-star KJ Apa and his wife. They've also been spotted at various public events.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chase-sui-wonders-and-ex-boyfriend-charles-melton-from-riverdale.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for whether or not Chase Sui Wonders is still with Charles Melton... it seems extremely, extremely unlikely... So much so that it's pretty safe to come right out and say that they have broken up. Not only have they not posted anything about each other for a few months, but, at the time of this writing, they don't even follow each other on Instagram. Oh, and then there's the fact that Chase has seemingly cozied up with every man's worst nightmare... Pete Davidson...</p><h2 id=is-pete-davidson-dating-chase-sui-wonders>Is Pete Davidson Dating Chase Sui Wonders?</h2><p>At the time of this writing, we can't be 100% sure if Pete Davidson is dating his Bodies, Bodies, Bodies co-star, Chase Sui Wonders. However, they have been spotted together on a number of occasions. And they've looked increasingly more comfortable with each other. For two people currently denying their dating rumors, they sure are doing a poor job of it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian Made Pete Davidson's Lifestyle Ten Times More Over The Top But Did He Actually Pay For Anything?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems the pair first met in 2021 while on the set of their film Bodies, Bodies, Bodies. Of course, Pete was in-deep in his relationship with Kim Kardashian at the time. But, as everyone and their dog knows, that relationship didn't go the distance. And it's assumed that Pete and Chase first became close on the set due to playing boyfriend and girlfriend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kim-kardashian-made-pete-davidson-s-lifestyle-ten-times-more-over-the-top-but-did-he-actually-pay-for-anything_.jpg><p>Bodies, Bodies, Bodies premiered at South By Southwest in March 2022 and went wide in August. But Pete Davidson and Chase Sui Wonders didn't appear to hang out publicly until after Pete and Emily Ratajkowski ended their brief fling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kim-kardashian-pete-davidson-left-and-emily-ratajkowski-right.jpg><p>So, what broke Pete and Chase back together after their Bodies, Bodies, Bodies experience? Well, presumably another gig. According to The Daily Mail, Pete and Chase will be working together again in his new Peacock series, Bupkis.</p><p>Over the course of just one week, Pete and Chase were spotted getting awfully close on three different occasions.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> According to The Daily Mail</a>, they were first spotted at a hockey game, then in a supermarket, and finally outside of his New York City apartment in late December 2022.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Pete Davidson's Relationship With Cazzie David Didn't End Very Well, Here's Why</a></span></p><p>Following these outings, the pair dispelled dating rumors. Apparently, they were just close friends. But you can't exactly blame the media for speculating when Pete Davidson continuously spends one-on-one time with a beautiful woman...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chase-sui-wonders-hot.jpg><p>Pete Davidson and Chase Sui Wonders added fuel to the fire of their dating speculations when they appeared in public for a 4th time in early January 2023. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to People</a>, the two attractive stars had a cozy meal together in Brooklyn. They sat on the same side of the table and Chase even had her arms wrapped around the sought-after ladies' man.</p><p>A source close to Pete stated told People that he was spending a lot of time with Chase for fun but it's not supposed to be a long-term thing. At the time of this writing, Pete Davidson's legitimate representation, nor the celebrity himself, has commented on these statements. Therefore, we have to take them with a grain of salt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nevertheless, there's no debating the fact that Pete and Chase have spent a lot of one-on-one time together and seem to love each other's company.
