None of&nbsp;those&nbsp;things serve me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e5oq%2BMnJ%2ByppFisbCv06ipmqyVYsCmucinmKuxXZi8rbjEoJxmaWJogXiAlW1ub2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
