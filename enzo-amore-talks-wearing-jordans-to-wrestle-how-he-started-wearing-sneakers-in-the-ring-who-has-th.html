You can read a few highlights below:&nbsp;</p><p>“It all adds to your character, whether it be visually or verbally, it’s just something that people can relate to. Anybody who’s a fan of Jordans&nbsp;and happens to have on the same pair of shoes I’m wearing when I’m in the ring has something to relate to with my character.”</p><p class=ng-scope>It’s actually a funny story. I used to wear wrestling boots when I first got signed to the WWE. It was mandatory that each and every single superstar under contract buy and wear boots, or wear&nbsp;amateur&nbsp;wrestling shoes, which are thin cut. It wasn’t a stipulation in our contract or anything, but when you showed up to wrestling school, the head coach would say “Hey do you got your wrestling boots?” So I had to go out and buy wrestling boots, which I had never worn before in my life. I did not feel comfortable in them.</p><p class=ng-scope>What ended up happening was I had a freak incident where I broke my leg in training in the performance center while wearing wrestling boots. It wasn’t so much “Oh, he was wearing wrestling boots,” but in my mind I was like “It’s the wrestling boot.”</p><p class=ng-scope>If you ever looked at the spectrum of people in the company wearing sneakers for a long period of time, it’s only John Cena. When I broke my leg I came to our head coach with a doctor’s note that said “Enzo needs to be wearing sneakers when he wrestles because he broke his leg and that’s what he feels comfortable in.” Breaking my leg was the be-all, end-all of wrestling boots [for me], and I turned it into an opportunity to capitalize on a market that I am infatuated with. When I came back, the first pair of shoes I wore when I got in the ring was the Ferrari 14&nbsp;Jordans.</p><p class=ng-scope>Oh, of course. I grew up a New York Knicks fan, a New York Giants fan, and a New York Yankees fan, so being in the area for &nbsp;hip-hop culture, sneakers and Jordan, you’re&nbsp;gonna&nbsp;see a little bit of that in my outfit, I assure you. That sneakerwatch is going to be serious. Sneakerheads are going to be scratching their heads like, “Is he really gonna one-and-done those?” It’s kind of like Ric Flair back in the day talking about his $2,000 alligator shoes. “I’m having a hard time holding these alligators down.” &nbsp;It’s 2016 and they’re not alligator sneakers, they’re Jordan Brand shoes and Enzo is going out and one-and-done’ing them.</p><p class=ng-scope>I’m #1 hands down in the business and in the game right now. Shane McMahon might give me a run for my money. First&nbsp;of all&nbsp;<a href=#>he’s got some customs that he wore on his feet at WrestleMania this past year</a>&nbsp;that are probably worth&nbsp;more than my collection alone. I think Tinker Hatfield made him a pair of&nbsp;30s&nbsp;or&nbsp;31s&nbsp;or something that was custom that he wore. It stops for me at about 14 because I don’t really wear much past that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwg5NrbmlvXZq7u7uMmqSoqpViwaK4yqxksJ2Rp7avs4yjpquckaPAbsDOZq6rnaOpuaZ5x6iuZqCVYsC1rdGtnJ1lp5qus7XNoGSsppWWuKa%2B0magp2WknbJuvsinnmavmKR6qa3SZquhnV2XsrTAjKyfqJ1dnK6usYyipWavp5o%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
