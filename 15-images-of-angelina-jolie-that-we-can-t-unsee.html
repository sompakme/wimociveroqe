She has a kind of a hypnotizing beauty that most people simply aren’t immune to, especially when she puts on a beautiful evening gown that highlights all of her best features.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is no denying that Angelina Jolie has a great sense of fashion and style and while we’ll always remember some of her outfits as some of the best outfits ever seen on the red carpet, there were times when she surprised us all with some pretty weird clothing choices. On the other hand, when you look like Angie, you often manage to pull off even the worst possible outfits that would look terrible on anybody else. That being said, it still doesn’t mean that you should do it.</p><p>However, even the greatest stars with the best stylists out there sometimes misjudge their overall look, which in the celebrity world almost never goes unnoticed. When you are a world-class star, the public doesn’t forgive easily that kind of things. And don't forget about the fashion critics, who often enjoy bashing celebs and their outfits. So let’s take a look at 15 times Angelina Jolie forgot to look in the mirror before leaving the house!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-gown-or-a-garbage-bag>A Gown Or A Garbage Bag?</h2><p>When it comes to the Hollywood’s worst and best-dressed lists that appear all over the internet after every significant event, Angelina Jolie, in most cases, doesn’t make it to either of these lists simply because she often plays it safe with her looks. But, on the other hand, most of the time, her usual style really works for her. However, this was the case when Angie’s name appeared on the "Worst Dressed" list after wearing a gown that looked like it was made from garbage bags to the world premiere of Disney's&nbsp;Maleficent. The shape of the dress itself wasn’t bad, but the material was really awkwardly looking and it didn’t go unnoticed. The combination of the black color and the incredibly shiny material just gave the overall impression like Angie was wearing one huge trash bag.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scary-much>Scary Much?</h2><p>This is definitely a version of Angelina Jolie you wouldn’t want to meet in some dark alley in the middle of the night. Truth to be told, she looks pretty scary here. Once again, she has that dark, almost gothic style going on and, even though she did rock some pretty awesome outfits while she was going through that phase, this wasn’t one of them. A long, black leather skirt? Really, Angelina? She definitely doesn’t look like a world-class star here. In fact, she doesn’t look like any kind of star at all, just like some angry lady that really wants to kick someone’s behind. It is really a good thing that her dark phase is over now and that she decided to embrace her feminine side that we all know and love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blast-from-the-past>Blast From The Past</h2><p>In all fairness, we have to say that this picture was snapped way back in 1998 when Angelina Jolie probably didn’t even have a stylist— or if she did, they were doing a pretty lousy job. In the past, Angie had that kind of a gothic look that we grew to love, and she kept some elements of it even today but in a much more sophisticated manner. But, when you look at this pic, you don’t really see her going with the goth style all the way through, nor do you see anything really classy or sophisticated about this particular look. All in all, it is just plain and boring and it is hard to believe that she actually wore this combination while walking down the red carpet. The same goes for her hair and makeup.</p><h2 id=is-she-going-to-a-funeral>Is She Going To A Funeral?</h2><p>This picture was taken in 2002 at the Golden Globe Awards back when Angie was with her ex, Billy Bob Thornton. They were known as a pretty unusual couple in a very intense relationship. For example, they used to wear vials with each other’s blood around their necks. Sound creepy? Well, after their breakup, they both admitted that ending the relationship was for the best because they both brought out the darkest parts of each other. And speaking of dark, what about those clothes they are wearing in this picture? They almost look as if they were about to go to a funeral after the party. Not only is the overall look way too dark, but you can also see that the dress doesn’t really fit Angelina right and the material seems a bit awkward.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=it-just-looks-cheap>It Just Looks Cheap</h2><p>In 90 percent of the cases, Angelina decided to stick to her regular style, consisting of long gowns, often with a thigh-high slit and most likely black. However, in 2010, she decided to go a completely different way when she attended the premiere of Salt in Los Angeles. The issue with this dress, even though it actually is an Emporio Armani dress, is the fact that it looks somehow cheap. It looks like a dress that some girl would wear when she goes clubbing, and it definitely doesn’t look like something worthy of Angelina Jolie. The people also seem to have an issue with Angelina’s legs claiming they are way too skinny and that her knees look weird. Well, when she wears a dress like this, you can actually see their point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angie-s-dark-aesthetic>Angie’s Dark Aesthetic</h2><p>So we know that Angie was working her dark aesthetic for a long time and she wore a lot of black Morticia Addams-like dresses. This was one of those cases and fashion critics weren’t too happy about it. This picture was snapped in 2000, shortly after Angelina divorced Johnny Lee Miller, at the Screen Actors Guild Awards in LA. Her hair was dyed black, she wore another long, black dress, but the worst part was the shawl she had wrapped around the shoulders because, even though it was supposed to soften the whole look up a little bit, it didn’t go well with that dress at all and it looked almost as she picked up the first random thing she could find to put around her shoulders. It was definitely not one of her best looks on the red carpet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-tomb-raider-premiere>The Tomb Raider premiere</h2><p>This look we can partially understand because we know what Angelina Jolie was probably going for here. She attended the Lara Croft: Tomb Raider premiere in L.A. dressed in a black tank-top and black leather pants and while it had a lot in common with her character in the movie, some people weren’t all that happy about seeing her dressed like this while walking down the red carpet. Whether you like or hate this outfit is really just a matter of personal preference. Some people believe the red carpet is every celebrity’s chance to show up wearing their loveliest gown and looking their best, while those with the less conservative approach thought the approach Angie took here was bold and cool. But no matter what you think, that tank-top really didn’t look too good.</p><h2 id=is-that-you-morticia>Is That You, Morticia?</h2><p>Everybody who’s ever seen the movie Girl, Interrupted knows that Angelina Jolie really did a good job with her role. However, when the time came for her to get her Academy Award for the best supporting actress in that role, she climbed the stage looking almost scary. With her long black hair and dressed in a long, tight black dress, she looked like Morticia Addams meeting Vampira. It was definitely not one of her best looks, especially when we take into the consideration that the occasion in question was the first and so far the only Oscar she has won. Black is usually a good choice, but there is just too much black color here, especially because the dress is covering her whole body. On the other hand, the Oscar in the pic definitely agrees with her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stars-they-re-just-like-us>Stars – They’re Just Like Us</h2><p>In all fairness, we probably shouldn’t expect celebrities to look their absolute best all the time, but this look is truly bad enough to get noticed and talked about. This picture was snapped in Queensland, Australia when she took her&nbsp;children shopping. By now, we all know that black is her favorite color when it comes to clothes, but she usually chooses much better clothing pieces than this. Seriously, look at those pants! Are those sweatpants? Dress pants? Who knows? But what we do know is that they don’t look nice at all! And let’s not even talk about all that mess on the top… It is pretty surprising that a celebrity like Angelina Jolie would even consider leaving her house looking like this. She obviously forgot to look at herself in the mirror— there is no other explanation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leather-pants-might-not-be-the-best-choice>Leather Pants&nbsp;Might Not Be The Best Choice</h2><p>Sometimes, even the best clothing combination looks bad if it doesn’t suit you right and that is the case with this picture. It is not that Angelina Jolie picked clothes that are downright ugly when this pic was snapped. In fact, the pants are pretty stylish and the top goes nice with them, but she just looks awfully skinny while wearing this combination. There has been a lot of talk about Angie being too skinny for her own good, and that is even highlighted with the pants as tight as those in the pic. Add black color that is naturally slimming into the mix and here you have a girl that looks almost like a walking skeleton. Skinny jeans are definitely not Angie’s best friends because they make her legs look like a pair of toothpicks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-that-even-a-dress>Is That Even A Dress</h2><p>We are used to seeing Angelina Jolie in long gowns, usually with thigh-high slits, and those dresses definitely agree with her so it’s no wonder she wears them so often. However, from time to time, she chooses to mix things up and she wears completely different kinds of dresses— some of them good, some of them not. This dress in the picture is totally different from what she usually wears; the only thing that remained the same is the black color. However, even though it was nice to see her wearing something different for a chance, the shape of the dress in the picture was pretty unfortunate – or better said, the lack of shape. It almost looks as if she just wrapped a piece of fabric around herself and hoped it would look good. Well, it didn’t.</p><h2 id=shapeless-black-dress>Shapeless Black Dress</h2><p>The dress Angelina Jolie wore to the&nbsp;Maleficent premiere&nbsp;in Tokyo is probably one of the worst outfits we have ever seen her wear. There isn’t anybody, literally ANYBODY, who could pull it off and actually look good in this weird, shapeless black thing. Everything about this dress is wrong— the shape, the material, the length… It is a complete miss in every aspect and one can’t help but wonder what Angie was thinking when she actually put this on and decided to leave the house dressed like this? There is not a single nice thing to be said about this outfit and, of course, people from all around the world have noticed it and made fun of it. If Angie’s stylist actually recommended her wearing this, let’s just hope she fired them right after the event.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=too-loose-to-look-good>Too Loose To Look Good</h2><p>This dress would be a great pick if you wanted to look at least 20 years older than you actually are. The first issue we have with this dress is the fact that it is too loose so it completely hides Angelina’s shape. Also, the overall look is just too plain and simple for a star such as Angelina Jolie. It would maybe be at least a bit more interesting if she went for some bolder color, but when you combine black with a dress shaped like this, it is just boring. On the other hand, we know that black is Angie’s favorite color when it comes to her clothes, so it was no big surprise that she decided to go black again. And while it usually works for her pretty well, this dress just didn’t cut it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-very-expensive-bathrobe>A Very Expensive Bathrobe</h2><p>At the Hollywood Film Awards, Angelina’s Hollywood hair looked perfect and her makeup was right on spot, but her silver Jenny Packham wrap gown looked awfully like a bathrobe—and a pretty expensive one for all that matters. The color of the gown looked really great on her, but the very shape of it seemed like something she would take off at any moment and the actual dress would appear beneath it. It is not that it didn’t suit her, it did, but a lot of people seemed to have a problem with it. The internet got pretty much divided in half—some people praised her Angie’s bold move to step out of her comfort zone with this gown, while all the others could see here was Angie wearing a bathrobe. What do you think?</p><h2 id=less-is-more>Less Is More</h2><p>People sometimes say that less is more of a reason, especially when it comes to clothes. In this particular case, there is simply too much going on with this black dress Angelina Jolie wore on the red carpet a few years back. Basically, if you are going to go with a thigh-high slit, you probably shouldn’t go for a plunging neckline as well. The dress almost looks as if someone unsuccessfully tried to cut it in half. The other issue is the awkward wrinkles in the front that aren’t flattering at all. All in all, the dress was just too much and the overall impression was that Angie was trying too hard to look attractive that night, which is a shame because of a person that beautiful really doesn’t need to put that much effort into looking good on the red carpet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKypobJwfZRmoKaZl5rAbrvFZpinn5Whtq%2BtjKOmpaGVYsGprdNmrp5lk5a7tXnUp6qenV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
