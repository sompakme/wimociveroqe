This led to the countess and costar </span><b><a href=#>Sonja Morgan</a></b><span> landing roles as friends of main character Julie Kessler (Klausner) in the series’ August 16 installment.</span></p><p><span>“I’ve had a lot of good one-liners on the </span><i>Housewives of New York</i><span>, so Julie’s always appreciated that and always found me very humorous, and so she wanted me to be funny in this,” de Lesseps tells <i>Us.</i></span></p><p><span>The countess adds that there are some similarities between herself and her</span><i> Difficult People</i><span> character: “I think it’s pretty true to how I am and how I might react — except for [causing a commotion] in public! [In one scene, our characters are] out watching a show in a theater, and [they’re] talking loud — that’s more <i>Housewives</i> than it is me. But it’s comical!”</span></p><p>De Lesseps points out with a laugh that Klausner and costar <b>Billy Eichner</b>‘s characters reminded her a bit of her <i>Housewives</i> cohorts. “Absolutely — they’re self-absorbed!” the Bravo star says. “They’re funny, and they’re characters that [made me] feel like, ‘I know them! They’re familiar to me!'”</p><p>Her role in the series isn’t the only reason why this is an exciting time for de Lesseps, as she is in the process of planning her <a href=#>New Year’s Eve nuptials to fiancé <b>Tom D’Agostino Jr.</b></a><b></b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“I just reached out to all my bridesmaids to get their sizes,” de Lesseps tells <i>Us</i>. “I’m working now on wedding dresses and getting our formal invitation out. So this is really the fun planning part, figuring out what I’m going to wear for the night. … I’m looking at dresses for every occasion for that evening, and then letting my bridesmaids know, ‘It’s time, girls — it’s time to get fitted for our dresses!’ It’s getting closer, so it’s getting more and more exciting.”</p><p><span>She confirms that both </span><i>RHONY</i><span> costar</span><b> Dorinda Medley</b><span> — who set up the happy couple — and series alum </span><b>Jill Zarin</b><span> will be in the wedding party. But which other Housewives will nab a spot on the guest list? Apparently, that still has yet to be finalized.</span></p><p>“I always say, we’ll see after the reunion who’s going to be invited — who behaves or who doesn’t,” the bride-to-be says. “I’m still working on my invites.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>De Lesseps’ episode of<i> Difficult People</i>, titled “Carter,” is now streaming on Hulu. <i>The Real Housewives of New York City</i> airs on Bravo Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmhp56uwG641Jqlp2WUmnqtsdKsnKmrXaeyt7HApapmr5iesKl5wqiqrZmiqHqutcahq2amn6l6qLHTZq6enJSeu6h5yKetoqyVqHq4gJJtbm9sXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
