A master class in high fashion, both the still images and teaser videos connected to <i>Renaissance</i> have featured Beyoncé wearing custom looks from coveted labels that range from Gucci and Alaïa to Schiaparelli and Mugler, as well as Los Angeles-based artist Nusi Quero, who crafted the piece the superstar wears while poised atop a holographic horse on the album’s cover, an image meant to evoke thoughts of Lady Godiva.</p><p>But beyond those teaser videos, plus the <a href=#>official “Renaissance” lyric videos</a>, there have been no full music videos yet released in support of the album.

Fashion photographer Mason Poole lensed the still images of the campaign, while Beyoncé’s longtime stylist, Marni Senofonte, who also worked on the artist’s 2016 <i>Lemonade</i>, worked with stylist and <i>Vogue Italia</i> editor-at-large Patti Wilson on the campaign. Fatima Robinson, whose work includes Pharrell Williams’s “Happy” and Meghan Trainor’s “All About the Bass,” was the choreographer on “Summer Renaissance.”</p><p>On Tuesday (October 4), guests attended Club Renaissance in celebration of Beyoncé’s globally lauded album ‘Renaissance,’ which started with the launch of the ‘Lose Yourself In Love’ Tiffany & Co. campaign anthem film, featuring Beyoncé.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyonce arrived at the event dripping Tiffany & Co. jewels mixing Tiffany & Co.

The jeweler also launched Tiffany Atrium, a social impact platform working alongside Beyoncé and husband JAY-Z to provide scholarships. According to a press release, in 2021, Tiffany & Co. pledged $2 million in scholarship funding for students in the arts and creative fields at HBCUs through 2024. That scholarship money has so far been awarded to more than 60 students.</p><p>The "Alien Superstar" singer has been working with Tiffany & Co. for years, starring in a number of campaigns, sometimes alongside her husband and even daughter Blue Ivy.</p><p>Romanek’s black-and-white film for <i>Renaissance</i> was shot using a rare 65mm camera and was conceptualized as an exploration of fearless creativity, says Alexandre Arnault, executive vp product and communications for Tiffany & Co. “‘Lose Yourself in Love’ embodies the beauty of self-love and empowered elegance,” he notes. “Beyoncé is an inspiration to so many because she embodies these qualities. We are honored to continue our partnership for the second year in a row and usher in an exciting new era of love.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b> Valérie Messika’s Diamond Luxurious Jewelry Collection Sparkles During Paris Fashion Week</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, <a href=#>Red Carpet Fashion Awards</a>, <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSvpsXOp5qeZZmoerW0xGaqrZmiYrynedOhnGammZy1tXnDq6CpqJmjtG61zWabopmdpLulv4yipWamlayytMCMraCfnpGjxm6vzmaamqWglraouo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
