Years ago, his father, <strong>Darrel Bishop</strong>, was put in jail for seven years after being caught in possession of a small amount of illegal substances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jamie-Foxx-Living-With-His-Parents-The-Graham-Norton-Show.jpg><p>“This man was an educator of kids in the inner city and he taught me everything I know,” the <a href=#>SAG nominee</a> explained, tearing up slightly as he remembered his father’s impact on his life.</p><p>The Grammy winner continued, “I couldn’t visit him in jail because I saw him as a king. But I wrote to him to say, ‘Things have gotten good for me and when you get out I will save your life,’ and he has been living with me for 20 years now.”</p><p>Supporting his father over the years has been rewarding, but Foxx’s living situation became even more unconventional when his mother, <strong>Louise Talley Dixon</strong>, decided to move in as well.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jamie-Foxx-Premiere-1-Just-Mercy.jpg><p>“I would always send her a ticket to come and visit, and about 12 years ago, she took me up on the offer and she came for Christmas,” Foxx said. “New Year’s came and went, then her birthday in January and then all of a sudden it was February and she hadn’t left.”</p><p>Foxx’s parents divorced more than 25 years ago, but the Beat Shazam host hasn’t been put in an uncomfortable position by their shared presence in his home.</p><p>“They live under the same roof and what’s crazy is that he still dates, and my mother will go to his side of the house to check things out!” Foxx <a href=#>joked</a>. “It’s a weirdly fun household.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZ2esm6yzrGvZqSZq7K0edaiq6FlmJ7AbrDIr6arm5WZerGt0Z6lratf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
