Children of celebrity parents are born into abundance and wealth but more importantly, into creative homes. These households usually support endeavors in the arts and encourage their children to pursue careers in the theatre. This is how there are so many second generation celebrities in the Hollywood circle. Having been exposed to the A-list celebrity world, it is not hard to figure out why some of the second generation celebrities are even more successful than their parents have been. It is more than plausible that they use their parent’s status and wisdom in the industry to help them land roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sometimes, the children of the celebrities end up making more money than their parents. In any case, the parents are probably thrilled to see their celebrity offspring thriving professionally and financially. As thrilling as it is for the public to see real life relationships on screen, it must also be exciting for the actors. In that case, do they fight over who gets more screen time? Or over who gets paid more money?</p><h2 id=angelina-jolie>Angelina Jolie</h2><p>It may not be a big shocker to find out that A-lister <a title="Angelina Jolie Net Worth" href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> is worth more than her famous father, <a title="Jon Voight Net Worth" href=#>Jon Voigt</a>. Jolie was born to Voight and ex-wife Marcheline Bertrand. Bertrand was an actress who gave up her career in order to raise her children. Jolie was raised between both New York City and Los Angeles. She said she had always wanted to become an actress. Jolie gained her fame through her first Academy Award for her role in <i>Girl Interrupted</i>. Her success has skyrocketed since and she was named Hollywood’s highest paid actress by Forbes in 2009 and 2011. Besides her acting career, she also promotes humanitarian causes. &nbsp;Jolie is worth an estimated $120 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jolie’s father, Jon Voigt, a successful actor in his own right, is worth approximately $45 million. Voigt had a successful film and TV career. He accumulated several Golden Globe awards throughout his long career. He also appeared on Broadway. His most famous role was in the film <i>Midnight Cowboy</i>, for which he got an Oscar nomination. Jolie and Voigt have had a tumultuous father-daughter relationship. She was estranged from her father for years because of his marital infidelity causing the breakup of their family. Years later, they reconciled. The father-daughter team even appeared on screen together in <i>Lara Croft: Tomb Raider</i>. Unfortunately, their relationship eventually deteriorated and Angelina even dropped ‘Voigt’ from her official name. At that point, Voigt declared publicly that his daughter suffered from mental issues. Angelina counteracted by publicly stating that she no longer wished to have any contact with her father. But it was the death of Jolie’s mother in 2007 that made them reconcile once more. With all this feuding and reconciling, at least Jolie will never have to run to daddy to borrow a couple of bucks!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=charlie-sheen>Charlie Sheen</h2><p>We hear <a title="Charlie Sheen Net Worth" href=#>Charlie Sheen</a>’s name and we think automatically: you’re fired!
