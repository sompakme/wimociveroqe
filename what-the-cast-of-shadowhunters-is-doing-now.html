Though the show was canceled and forced to wrap up its story in a special finale, the show had a dedicated fanbase and viewers thoroughly enjoyed the supernatural show. Shadowhunters followed Clary Fray, played by Katherine McNamara, as she is thrown into a world of angels and monsters.

They have jumped from project to project, and many have actually come back together to work with each other again. Harry Shum Jr. has been busy making movies, while McNamara is about to be the lead in another show. Here’s everything the cast of Shadowhunters have been doing since the show ended.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Is The Most Followed ‘Shadowhunters’ Star On Instagram In 2021?</a></span></p><h2 id=isaiah-mustafa-broke-his-hand-filming-it-chapter-two><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Isaiah Mustafa Broke His Hand Filming It: Chapter Two</span></h2><p>Isaiah Mustafa waited a long time for an opportunity like It: Chapter Two. Ever since his iconic Old Spice campaign in 2010, Mustafa struggled to be taken seriously in the acting business. Shadowhunters was a welcome change as the actor was able to play the parental figure Luke Garroway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since his time on the Freeform show, Mustafa landed the lead role in the second installment of the It franchise, It: Chapter Two. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mustafa actually broke his hand while filming</a>! “I did that [chair-slamming] so many times, and they kept bringing chairs… I don’t know what I did, but it kicked back on me or something.”</p><h2 id=luke-baines-wrote-untitled-horror-movie><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Luke Baines Wrote Untitled Horror Movie</span></h2><p>In Shadowhunters, Luke Baines played the second version of Jonathan Morgenstern.

During the pandemic, many actors were struggling to find work, and Baines took it upon himself to create a work of art. With the help of Nick Simon, Baines wrote Untitled Horror Movie, a comedic horror film which he then starred in as Declan. Katherine McNamara, his television sister on Shadowhunters, also joined the cast.</p><h2 id=harry-shum-jr-stars-in-all-my-life><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Harry Shum Jr. Stars In All My Life</span></h2><p>Harry Shum Jr. has had quite an interesting career in Hollywood.
