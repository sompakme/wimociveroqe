Being in the public eye requires these individuals to wear clothing that does not stand out from the norm. No more is body armor the dominion of politicians and the military, it is now available for the elite who can afford it. Today's armor is no longer bulky and uncomfortable, modern day technology has introduced new lightweight materials that are barely discernable from ordinary fabric and textiles. The next evolution in fashion is bulletproof clothing, correctly called ballistic or bullet resistant clothing that protects its wearer from projectiles fired at close range.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Textile armor is classified as soft body armor, it works by dissipating the kinetenergy of the bullet by absorbing kinetic energy. Ballistic or textile armor is tested by the U.S. National Institute of Justice by placing modeling clay in the backing of the fabric. The armor is then fired upon, the clay is then tested for penetration resistance comparing the backface indentation left on the clay. This test is extremely important in determining the rate of impact in relation to potential organ damage.</p><p>The kinetic energy of a bullet is the main factor determining if a bullet will penetrate an object. The effectiveness of body armor is determined by how effective the body armor absorbs this energy.</p><p>The common standard for body armor in the U.S.A. is the US National Institute of Justice (NIJ) model. The NIJ is considered the standard for ballistic body armor. The standards of body armor are broken down into the threat assessment poised against the wearer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are six types of classifications, the type of clothing featured here falls under the Type IIIA designation. Type IIIA shielding protects against the .357 Magnum, .44, and 9mm calibers. For the wealthy you can now be fashionable and protected all at the same time.</p><p>Legitimate body armor will display an easy to read code that displays the level of protection it affords. NIJ Level II bullet proof vest will protect against 9mm, .44 Magnum and .357 Magnum projectiles. Level IIIA are heavier and thicker than Level II bullet proof vests.&nbsp;Although Level II and Level IIIA soft body armor will protect against most handguns, for additional protection armor plate inserts are indispensable for the wearers protection.</p><p>New advances in technology has resulted in materials and fabrics that are light weight and less bulky.
