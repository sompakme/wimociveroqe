During a no-holds-barred interview with <b>Howard Stern</b> on Monday, March 6, the cyclist admitted that it was “tough” being a power couple. Watch the video above.</p><p>“Yeah, it was a roll, man,” Armstrong, 45, told Stern when asked if his head got big when he was dating the country superstar in the early 2000s. “It was a good ride. She’s a great lady. Obviously it didn’t work out, but I think and I hope she’s happy. I’m happy, but yeah … I watched the Grammys the other day … and we were like presenters at the Grammys … And at the time, I was like, ‘I’ve got to go do what?’ [It was surreal].”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lance-armstrong-sheryl-crowe-inline-4c3be0e6-4fef-4c89-b343-4dd4af159c21.jpg><p>Armstrong, who was banned from cycling after he admitted to doping during a now infamous 2013 interview with <b>Oprah Winfrey</b>, told Stern that it was hard being in a relationship in the spotlight.</p><p>“It’s tough to pull it off. I mean, how many couples have been able to pull it off?” the former athlete said of being a power couple, before going on to praise Crow. “To her credit, she was a stay-at-home — one of the biggest rockstars — but … she was a great partner. She was at the races … it wasn’t like we never saw each other.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>As previously reported, the Forward podcast host and Crow called off their engagement in February 2006 after years of dating. In his book, <i>Lance</i>, he explained that they split because he wasn’t ready to have kids.</p><p>“She wanted marriage, she wanted children; and not that I didn’t want that, but I didn’t want that at that time because I had just gotten out of a marriage, I’d just had kids,” Armstrong wrote. “Yet we’re up against her biological clock — that pressure is what cracked it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Armstrong, who was previously married to <b>Kristin Richard</b>, is the dad of five kids: Luke, 17, and twins Grace and Isabelle, 15, with Richard; and Max, 7, and Olivia, 6, with current girlfriend <b>Anna Hansen</b>.&nbsp;Crow is mom to kids Wyatt, 9, and Levi, 6.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmZ6Ysm6t0aaqraqfo7RuvsScmKWko2LAqbHRsqNmm6KkxG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mrm1vYGuEens%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
