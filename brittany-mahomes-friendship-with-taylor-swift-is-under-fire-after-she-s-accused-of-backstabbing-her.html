Ever since Swift started her <a href=#>compelling relationship with Travis Kelce</a>, she has met his whole family and also become close to <strong>Kelce's teammate <a href=#>Patrick Mahomes</a>' wife Brittany Mahomes</strong>.</p><p>There's no question that Brittany's profile has been raised in the past year. For example, Brittany and Patrick Mahomes went to the Time 100 Gala in April 2024 and The Daily Mail reported on her crop top and impressive abs. However, as The Daily Mail reported, there was also talk of trouble between the two famous friends. In this article, we'll take a look at <strong>the truth about Brittany Mahomes and Taylor Swift's friendship </strong>and the accusation that <strong>Brittany wanted to be friends with Swift so she could make money</strong>. We'll also take a look at their friendship history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-brittany-mahomes-use-taylor-swift-for-fame-and-money>Did Brittany Mahomes Use Taylor Swift For Fame And Money?</h2><p><strong>Brittany Mahomes has been accused of using Taylor Swift for money</strong>, according to The Daily Mail. Sources close to Swift have noticed some odd things, and if these claims are true, it definitely doesn't look good. If these claims are true, then Brittany wanted to become friends with Swift in order to become more famous so she could add to her net worth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/did-taylor-swift-save-brittany-mahomes-tarnished-image_.jpg><p>To start with, <strong>Brittany once tweeted negative things about Swift</strong>, asking when she would "find something different to write about besides boys and relationships." She also tweeted, "Taylor Swift winning everything." Some people believe that if Brittany really felt that way about Swift and her music, then she only wants to be friends with her because of Swift's fame. If this is true, then Brittany thinks that being photographed with Swift at Kansas City Chiefs games can help her make money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ttweb_did-taylor-swift-ever-write-a-song-about-tom-hiddleston-_bk_a1_v3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Taylor Swift Ever Write A Song About Tom Hiddleston?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift has written some iconic songs about her ex boyfriends, but is Tom Hiddleston one of them?</span><p>A source told Life & Style Magazine:</p><p>“Taylor wasn’t happy. She’s used to people saying nasty things about her, but this was someone she’s welcomed into her squad.”</p><p>The source continued that Brittany apologized and said "she was just a stupid teenager" and they moved on.</p><p>However, when <strong><a href=#>Brittany posed for Kim Kardashian's Skims line</a></strong>, people were shocked. Since Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian have had conflict for a long time, Swift's fans and sources close to her are confused that Brittany would make that business decision. It's possible to say that Brittany ignored the tension between Swift and Kim because she wanted to make money from the Skims endorsement. While it's unknown how much she was paid, it must have been a good amount.</p><p>A source said:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She has tried so hard to insert herself into Swift's circle...

According to Hello! Magazine, her net worth grew to $30 million in 2023. If that is the case, then Brittany made a lot of money in 2023.

Since <strong>Swift has a song called "Wildest Dreams" </strong>on her "1989" album, many thought she said that on purpose. While she might have been trying to compliment her friend, many people thought it was the wrong thing to say. It's unclear if Swift was upset about this or felt that it was a problematic comment. People think it's another sign that Brittany used Swift so she could become more successful.</p><p>Many wonder <a href=#>if Brittany Mahomes likes her fame</a> because people insult Brittany regularly. But it seems like the backlash about her friendship with Taylor Swift is sticking. No one really knows if Brittany is using Swift for money unless she confirms it. If this was true, it seems unlikely that she would admit it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1-4-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it's clear that people aren't fans of this friendship and don't believe that Brittany has good intentions. Redditor @ExoticCheesecake6488 wrote:</p><p>"Brittany is an acquaintance of Taylor. Not a true friend."</p><p>Redditor @writerchrs posted earlier in 2024 that perhaps Brittany and Swift's friendship soured a bit.

In fact, the people close to them claim that they are genuinely pals. Their friendship has consisted of dinner dates and attending several Kansas City Chiefs games together. While those were public events, it's also possible that they have spent a lot of time together with no cameras around.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/brittany-mahomes.jpg><p>In February 2024, Patrick Mahomes' mom <strong>Randi said Brittany Mahomes and Taylor Swift's friendship is "real."</strong> According to her comments, it sounds like the two met because of their partners' football careers in summer or fall 2023 and bonded.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/taylor-swift-s-most-quotable-lyrics-ranked-1-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift's Most Quotable Lyrics Ranked, According To Reddit</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Since the start of her career with Tim McGraw, and now with her 'Taylor's Version' albums, Swift has had some of the most quotable song lyrics.</span><p>Randi said in an interview with Page Six:</p><p>“It’s hard at this point to meet people that are true and real and they kind of found each other.
