The couple is reportedly also getting divorced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sanchez and Whitesell, who owned a home in Seattle, have been known to socialize with Bezos and his wife in the past. The former anchor, 49, has also worked as a helicopter pilot and has an aerial production firm that took aerial shots for Blue Origin, a company Bezos founded in 2000. She has been a contributor on "The View," "Larry King Live," "Showbiz Tonight," and "The Joy Behar Show," among others. The couple has been married for 14 years and have two children. Sanchez also has a son from her first marriage to former NFL player Tony Gonzalez.</p><p>Sanchez and Bezos were spotted in LA on Sunday at <a href=#>Amazon's Golden Globes after-party</a>. According to the New York Post, Bezos announced his divorce yesterday knowing that photos of the two were set to be published. Bezos' wife, however, apparently knew the two were an item. "The news today was not a surprise to her. Lauren was with Jeff at the Golden Globes because they are dating," a source close to Bezos said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>TMZ reported today that Bezos and his wife did not sign a prenuptial agreement and will file for divorce in Washington, where state divorce law considers all assets accrued during a marriage community property, therefore, <a href=#>the court usually splits the property equitably</a>. Despite not having a prenup, the couple may have another arrangement intended to protect Amazon.</p><p>"It's unlikely there’s any risk to the company," said Stuart Slotnick, chairman of the matrimonial department of law firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney in New York City.
