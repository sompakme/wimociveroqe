They described the relationship as “tumultuous” and adds they “only talk through lawyers.”</p><p>The source claims that Britney misses Sam, implying the pop star may regret past behavior that pushed her husband to choose divorce. “[She] wants Sam back badly,” they said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She misses the fun they used to have together," they said.

The clip has since been removed.</p><p>"The time he picked me up… It’s weird cause there are always strange turns for relationships with friends family or your loved ones in the [rollercoaster emoji] of any journey you’re on with someone!!!" Britney wrote via Instagram. "Looking back is hard sometimes but it’s honestly crucial … I’m honestly too sensitive in most situations.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britney continued, "I speak about my past sometimes because I want to protect myself from the same mistakes as before!!!

"Being numb is the worst, I think, but there’s safety in that cause I feel like I’m subconsciously protecting myself from feeling any importance at all !!! It’s tricky cause that’s what people can take advantage of."</p><p>Prior to that, Britney made a post reflecting on why she believes she struggles to make relationships work, seeming to take ownership for their break-up. Despite her candidness, Britney hasn’t addressed the recent allegations that she wants Sam back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer reportedly has a new man in her life, Paul Soliz, a former employee who’s also sparked concerns amongst her fans due to his criminal background. There have been reports that those close to Britney are also worried about their romance. For his part, Sam has denied that he’s back to dating, rather showing off his body transformation online and saying he’s focusing on acting. It remains unclear why Britney and Sam have yet to finalize their divorce.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq6Gko7K6edKpnJqqo2LEorrTrGSsmZ1irrSzx5qpomWSlrCsedGena6rlah6tLHTraOeZZSew7C%2Bwp5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
