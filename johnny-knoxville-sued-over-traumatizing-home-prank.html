When Khalil tried to call authorities, he claims one of the men towing his vehicle said he’d get arrested for cocaine possession – and proceeded to show him a clear bag with white power, insinuating they would plant the drugs.</p><p>“At this point, Plaintiff was in a panic,” court documents state. “In the span of just minutes, he had been threatened with being beaten up, told he botched the repair job, accused of murdering a pony, had his car taken without his permission, and was now being told that he would be arrested for possession of illicit narcotics.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eventually, Johnny revealed to Khalil the antics were all part of an elaborate home prank. The handyman says he was offered money for his participation.</p><p>However, it seems that Khalil didn’t leave laughing. His lawsuit claims the prank subjected him to emotional distress and gave him anxiety. He also says it can harm his business reputation. Khalil is seeking unspecific damages.</p><p>The lawsuit continues, “Plaintiff was not amused, and remains unamused. He has been badly shaken and traumatized by this episode.”</p><p>According to <a href=#>Variety</a>, the prank was filmed for Johnny’s new show The Prank Patrol, which is set to premiere on ABC in 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show follows Johnny as well as Eric Andre and Gabourey Sidibe as the prank unsuspecting people in their regular lives. They also give a behind-the-scenes look at how the elaborate pranks are held.</p><p>Johnny’s pranks are no stranger to controversy. When filming Jackass Forever, the comedian <a href=#>revealed he suffered brain damage</a> following a stunt that went wrong.</p><p>At the time, he hinted that it may be the end of his prank career, but it appears that wasn’t the case. But perhaps this pending lawsuit will make him think differently.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, & Post Malone All Hit With Same NFT Lawsuit</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>Variety</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3sLTNp7Bmo56kxbe1y6WcZqulmrFuu9WeqWasopbCrq3TorGippditbC5xGanq5meoHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
