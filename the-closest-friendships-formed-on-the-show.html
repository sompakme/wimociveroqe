Whether they found love or not, many found long-lasting friendships. This show takes a toll on cast members' mental health while trying to find love, and many found strong friendships that lasted months after filming the show.</p><h2 id=danielle-and-deepti-became-best-friends><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Danielle And Deepti Became Best Friends</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans' favorite duo from Love Is Blind: Season 2 is Danielle and Deepti. The two ladies went on the show to find love and found a best friend within each other. Danielle has received a lot of hate, especially on her Instagram page, since the show aired. Deepti understands Danielle's very open discussion about mental health issues and has continuously supported Danielle in her struggles. Although many fans view Danielle's behavior on the show as gaslighting and projecting her insecurities onto Nick, others see her as a mental health advocate and praise her for raising awareness. Whichever way someone sees it, Deepti has been emphasizing the importance of kindness and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">asking fans to stop leaving hate comments on Danielle's Instagram account.</a> Deepti talks a lot about how awesome her new best friend is, regardless of how she was portrayed.</p><h2 id=sentimental-posts-about-true-friendship><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Sentimental Posts About True Friendship</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The strongest friendship formed on the show is by far Danielle and Deepti. The two girls had different outcomes at the finale but have been supporting each other through it all. On both Danielle and Deepti's Instagram accounts, they have shared emotional posts about how strong the other friend is. Danielle gets married after an emotional rollercoaster with Nick, while Deepti excites fans when she stands up Shake at the altar after a season of his horrible comments. The two friends helped each other through the process and have stayed close ever since. Deepti was engaged to a man who publicly humiliated her throughout the entire season, while Danielle has received horrific backlash for her mental health struggles on the show, and the two ladies have been each other's number one supporter since the beginning.</p><h2 id=shaina-loves-deepti-too-but-is-it-mutual><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Shaina Loves Deepti Too, But Is It Mutual?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shaina isn't much of a fan favorite, but she did take to Instagram to show her love for Deepti. Who isn't best friends with Deepti after this season?! Deepti shares some love with Shaina on Instagram, but it's still debatable if Shaina left the show with any friends. Shaina accepted Kyle's proposal, and while being engaged, still tried to win over Shayne. On the "Viall Files" podcast, hosted by Nick Viall, who appeared on The Bachelor and two seasons of The Bachelorette, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaina reveals that she is in a serious relationship.</a> Fans will have to wait until the reunion to find out if Shaina truly has any friends left after the drama she caused on this season.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Love Is Blind' Season 2 Cast Boasts Diversity, Details Revealed</a></span></p><h2 id=possibly-two-happily-married-couples><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Possibly Two Happily Married Couples</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Only two out of the five couples had both partners say 'I do' at the altar: Iyanna and Jarrette and Danielle and Nick. While Iyanna and Jarrette's relationship seems more easy-going and happy, fans are waiting for the reunion to see if they are still together. Danielle and Nick, on the other han, shocked fans when they both said 'I do'. There's also the possibility that any of the three couples who split up on the season finale have made amends with each other and are still together.</p><h2 id=definitely-not-natalie-and-shaina><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Definitely Not Natalie And Shaina</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While they could easily throw the viewers a curveball at the upcoming reunion episode, most fans aren't expecting Natalie and Shaina to be friends now. Even Love Is Blind's official Instagram page shared this photo, along with a preview of the reunion, where there is some clear tension between the two ladies. Shaina made an appearance to talk to Natalie's fianc√©, Shayne, in attempt to win him back and say that Natalie isn't the one for him. Naturally, Natalie doesn't seem to be Shaina's biggest fan.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Love Is Blind Season 2 Episode 10 Review: 'The Weddings'</a></span></p><h2 id=shake-and-cast-members-who-didn-39-t-get-air-time><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Shake And Cast Members Who Didn't Get Air Time</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There were many cast members that were shown in the beginning episodes of this season that didn't make it past the pods. While it's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">been revealed that two couples got engaged but didn't get any air time</a>, a few have been photographed with Shake since the show aired. Both couples ended up splitting after the show, and it looks like some have found a friendship in Shake. While being the season's designated villain, Shake doesn't appear to have any friends that made it throughout the entire season, but Shake is hanging out with Jason and Joey, along with Brandon, who didn't get engaged, The boys have been partying it up and enjoying the single life since meeting on the show.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Does The Cast Of 'Love Is Blind' Get Paid?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijqK6VYra0ecGloKecXam1pnnCpaasnaOpeqe%2ByJ6lnauYnr20ecWoqaadlGK8r3nToZxmq5ikxHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
